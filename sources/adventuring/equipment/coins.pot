"# Coins \n"
"Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative "
"worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are "
"the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).     "
"\n"
"With one gold piece, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 feet of good rope, or "
"a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a "
"day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the "
"coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve "
"goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the "
"transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, "
"the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in "
"gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.    \n"
"One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among "
"commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for half a day, a flask of "
"lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.    \n"
"One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers "
"and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of "
"chalk.    \n"
"In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in "
"treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) "
"originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse "
"suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is "
"worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.    "
"\n"
"A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a "
"pound.\n"
