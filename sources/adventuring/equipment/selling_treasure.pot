"# Selling Treasure \n"
"Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more "
"in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and "
"trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you "
"can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.     \n"
"**Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment.** As a general rule, undamaged weapons, "
"armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a "
"market. Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough "
"condition to sell.    \n"
"**Magic Items.** Selling magic items is problematic. Finding someone to buy "
"a potion or a scroll isn't too hard, but other items are out of the realm of "
"most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common magic "
"items, you won't normally come across magic items or spells to purchase. The "
"value of magic is far beyond simple gold and should always be treated as "
"such.     \n"
"**Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects.** These items retain their full value in "
"the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or use them as "
"currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the "
"GM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community "
"first.     \n"
"**Trade Goods.** On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions "
"through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods--bars of iron, bags "
"of salt, livestock, and so on--retain their full value in the market and can "
"be used as currency.\n"
