"# Adventuring Gear \n"
"This section describes items that have special rules or require further "
"explanation.     \n"
"**Acid.** As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a "
"creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it "
"on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or "
"object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target "
"takes 2d6 acid damage.    \n"
"**Alchemist's Fire.** This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to "
"air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on "
"impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the "
"alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 "
"fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this "
"damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the "
"flames.    \n"
"**Antitoxin.** A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on "
"saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or "
"constructs.    \n"
"**Arcane Focus.** An arcane focus is a special item--an orb, a crystal, a "
"rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some "
"similar item--designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, "
"warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.    \n"
"**Ball Bearings.** As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from "
"their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A "
"creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity "
"saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed "
"doesn't need to make the save.    \n"
"**Block and Tackle.** A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them "
"and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up "
"to four times the weight you can normally lift.    \n"
"**Book.** A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information "
"pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish "
"contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text "
"or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this "
"section).    \n"
"**Caltrops.** As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a "
"square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must "
"succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take "
"1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature's walking speed "
"by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature "
"moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the save.    \n"
"**Candle.** For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and "
"dim light for an additional 5 feet.   \n"
"**Case, Crossbow Bolt.** This wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow "
"bolts.   \n"
"**Case, Map or Scroll.** This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten "
"rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment.    \n"
"**Chain.** A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC "
"20 Strength check.   \n"
"**Climber's Kit.** A climber's kit includes special pitons, boot tips, "
"gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber's kit as an action to anchor "
"yourself; when you do, you can't fall more than 25 feet from the point where "
"you anchored yourself, and you can't climb more than 25 feet away from that "
"point without undoing the anchor.   \n"
"**Component Pouch.** A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt "
"pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other "
"special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that "
"have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell's description).   \n"
"**Crowbar.** Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the "
"crowbar's leverage can be applied.   \n"
"**Druidic Focus.** A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a "
"wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out "
"of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and "
"teeth from sacred animals. A druid can use such an object as a spellcasting "
"focus.   \n"
"**Fishing Tackle.** This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood "
"bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting.   \n"
"**Healer's Kit.** This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, "
"and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of "
"the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to "
"make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.   \n"
"**Holy Symbol.** A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It "
"might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol "
"carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding "
"a fragment of a sacred relic. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a "
"spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it "
"in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.   \n"
"**Holy Water.** As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto "
"a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on "
"impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, "
"treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or "
"undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage.   \n"
"A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special "
"ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered "
"silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.    \n"
"**Hunting Trap.** When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a "
"saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure "
"plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile "
"object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that "
"steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take "
"1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks "
"free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain "
"(typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 "
"Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a "
"success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.    "
"\n"
"**Lamp.** A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an "
"additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of "
"oil.   \n"
"**Lantern, Bullseye.** A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot "
"cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours "
"on a flask (1 pint) of oil.   \n"
"**Lantern, Hooded.** A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius "
"and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a "
"flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the "
"light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.    \n"
"**Lock.** A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature "
"proficient with thieves' tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 "
"Dexterity check. Your GM may decide that better locks are available for "
"higher prices.   \n"
"**Magnifying Glass.** This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is "
"also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting "
"fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as "
"sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to "
"ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to "
"appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed.   \n"
"**Manacles.** These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium "
"creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity "
"check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of "
"manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with "
"thieves' tools can pick the manacles' lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity "
"check. Manacles have 15 hit points.   \n"
"**Mess Kit.** This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps "
"together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate "
"or shallow bowl.   \n"
"**Oil.** Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, "
"you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or "
"throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack "
"against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised "
"weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire "
"damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional "
"5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the "
"ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If "
"lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that "
"enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this "
"damage only once per turn.   \n"
"**Poison, Basic.** You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing "
"or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison "
"takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must "
"make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once "
"applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.   \n"
"**Potion of Healing.** A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this "
"vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an "
"action.   \n"
"**Pouch.** A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 "
"blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding "
"spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this "
"section).   \n"
"**Quiver.** A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows.   \n"
"**Ram, Portable.** You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When "
"doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can "
"help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.   \n"
"**Rations.** Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, "
"including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.   \n"
"**Rope.** Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be "
"burst with a DC 17 Strength check.   \n"
"**Scale, Merchant's.** A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a "
"suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the "
"exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, "
"to help determine their worth.   \n"
"**Spellbook.** Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome "
"with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells.   \n"
"**Spyglass.** Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their "
"size.   \n"
"**Tent.** A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two.   \n"
"**Tinderbox.** This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder "
"(usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to "
"light a torch--or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel--takes an "
"action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.   \n"
"**Torch.** A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot "
"radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack "
"with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.\n"
