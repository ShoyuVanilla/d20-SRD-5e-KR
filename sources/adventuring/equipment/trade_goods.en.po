"# Trade Goods\n"
"Most wealth is not in coins. It is measured in livestock, grain, land, "
"rights to collect taxes, or rights to resources (such as a mine or a "
"forest).    \n"
"Guilds, nobles, and royalty regulate trade. Chartered companies are granted "
"rights to conduct trade along certain routes, to send merchant ships to "
"various ports, or to buy or sell specific goods. Guilds set prices for the "
"goods or services that they control, and determine who may or may not offer "
"those goods and services. Merchants commonly exchange trade goods without "
"using currency. The Trade Goods table shows the value of commonly exchanged "
"goods.\n"
