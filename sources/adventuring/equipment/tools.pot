"# Tools \n"
"A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or "
"repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your race, class, "
"background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency "
"with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check "
"you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since "
"proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. For "
"example, the GM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine "
"detail with your woodcarver's tools, or a Strength check to make something "
"out of particularly hard wood.   \n"
"**Artisan's Tools.** These special tools include the items needed to pursue "
"a craft or trade. The table shows examples of the most common types of "
"tools, each providing items related to a single craft. Proficiency with a "
"set of artisan's tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability "
"checks you make using the tools in your craft. Each type of artisan's tools "
"requires a separate proficiency.    \n"
"**Disguise Kit.** This pouch of cosmetics, hair dye, and small props lets "
"you create disguises that change your physical appearance. Proficiency with "
"this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make "
"to create a visual disguise.   \n"
"**Forgery Kit.** This small box contains a variety of papers and parchments, "
"pens and inks, seals and sealing wax, gold and silver leaf, and other "
"supplies necessary to create convincing forgeries of physical "
"documents. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to "
"any ability checks you make to create a physical forgery of a document.   \n"
"**Gaming Set.** This item encompasses a wide range of game pieces, including "
"dice and decks of cards (for games such as Three-Dragon Ante). A few common "
"examples appear on the Tools table, but other kinds of gaming sets exist. If "
"you are proficient with a gaming set, you can add your proficiency bonus to "
"ability checks you make to play a game with that set. Each type of gaming "
"set requires a separate proficiency.    \n"
"**Herbalism Kit.** This kit contains a variety of instruments such as "
"clippers, mortar and pestle, and pouches and vials used by herbalists to "
"create remedies and potions. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your "
"proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to identify or apply "
"herbs. Also, proficiency with this kit is required to create antitoxin and "
"_potions of healing_.    \n"
"**Musical Instrument.** Several of the most common types of musical "
"instruments are shown on the table as examples. If you have proficiency with "
"a given musical instrument, you can add your proficiency bonus to any "
"ability checks you make to play music with the instrument. A bard can use a "
"musical instrument as a spellcasting focus. Each type of musical instrument "
"requires a separate proficiency.    \n"
"**Navigator's Tools.** This set of instruments is used for navigation at "
"sea. Proficiency with navigator's tools lets you chart a ship's course and "
"follow navigation charts. In addition, these tools allow you to add your "
"proficiency bonus to any ability check you make to avoid getting lost at "
"sea.   \n"
"**Poisoner's Kit.** A poisoner's kit includes the vials, chemicals, and "
"other equipment necessary for the creation of poisons. Proficiency with this "
"kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to "
"craft or use poisons.   \n"
"**Thieves' Tools.** This set of tools includes a small file, a set of lock "
"picks, a small mirror mounted on a metal handle, a set of narrow-bladed "
"scissors, and a pair of pliers. Proficiency with these tools lets you add "
"your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to disarm traps or "
"open locks.\n"
