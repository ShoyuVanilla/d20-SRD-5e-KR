"# Armor \n"
"Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different "
"cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers "
"have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain "
"mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in "
"between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor "
"found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, "
"medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a "
"shield.    \n"
"The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common "
"types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.    \n"
"**Armor Proficiency.** Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield "
"to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it "
"effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of "
"armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have "
"disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that "
"involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.     \n"
"**Armor Class (AC).** Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and "
"shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.   \n"
"**Heavy Armor.** Heavier armor interferes with the wearer's ability to move "
"quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows \"Str 13\" or "
"\"Str 15\" in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the "
"wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or "
"higher than the listed score.    \n"
"**Stealth.** If the Armor table shows \"Disadvantage\" in the Stealth "
"column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.     \n"
"**Shields.** A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one "
"hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit "
"from only one shield at a time. \n"

"## Light Armor \n"
"Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers "
"since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear "
"light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your "
"armor type to determine your Armor Class.    \n"
"**Padded.** Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.    "
"\n"
"**Leather.** The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made "
"of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the "
"armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.     \n"
"**Studded Leather.** Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather "
"is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes. \n"

"## Medium Armor\n"
"Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs "
"movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to "
"a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your "
"Armor Class.    \n"
"**Hide.** This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly "
"worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to "
"the tools and materials needed to create better armor.    \n"
"**Chain Shirt.** Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn "
"between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection "
"to the wearer's upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against "
"one another to be muffled by outer layers.     \n"
"**Scale Mail.** This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a "
"separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much "
"like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.    \n"
"**Breastplate.** This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with "
"supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, "
"this armor provides good protection for the wearer's vital organs while "
"leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.     \n"
"**Half Plate.** Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most "
"of the wearer's body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple "
"greaves that are attached with leather straps. \n"

"## Heavy Armor \n"
"Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These "
"suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range "
"of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.    \n"
"Heavy armor doesn't let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, "
"but it also doesn't penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.    "
"\n"
"**Ring Mail.** This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into "
"it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and "
"axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it's usually worn only by "
"those who can't afford better armor.     \n"
"**Chain Mail.** Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a "
"layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to "
"cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.    \n"
"**Splint.** This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to "
"a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail "
"protects the joints.     \n"
"**Plate.** Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the "
"entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a "
"visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles "
"and straps distribute the weight over the body.\n"
