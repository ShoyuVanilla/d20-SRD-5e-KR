"# Time \n"
"In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the "
"GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different time "
"scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon "
"environment, the adventurers' movement happens on a scale of **minutes**. It "
"takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to "
"check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes "
"to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.    \n"
"In a city or wilderness, a scale of **hours** is often more "
"appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the "
"forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours' time.     "
"\n"
"For long journeys, a scale of **days** works best. Following the road from "
"Baldur's Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four uneventful days "
"before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey.   \n"
"In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on **rounds**, a "
"6-second span of time.\n"
