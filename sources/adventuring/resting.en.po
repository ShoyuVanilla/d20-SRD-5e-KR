"# Resting \n"
"Heroic though they might be, adventurers can't spend every hour of the day "
"in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need "
"rest--time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and "
"spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.    \n"
"Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a "
"long rest to end the day. \n"

"## Short Rest \n"
"A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a "
"character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and "
"tending to wounds.    \n"
"A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to "
"the character's maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the "
"character's level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the "
"die and adds the character's Constitution modifier to it. The character "
"regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an "
"additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice "
"upon finishing a long rest, as explained below. \n"

"## Long Rest \n"
"A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during "
"which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, "
"eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is "
"interrupted by a period of strenuous activity--at least 1 hour of walking, "
"fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity--the characters "
"must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.    \n"
"At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The "
"character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half "
"of the character's total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, "
"if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice "
"upon finishing a long rest.    \n"
"A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, "
"and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to "
"gain its benefits.\n"
