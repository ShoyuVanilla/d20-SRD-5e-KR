"# Movement \n"
"Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a "
"treacherous mountain slope--all sorts of movement play a key role in fantasy "
"gaming adventures.   \n"
"The GM can summarize the adventurers' movement without calculating exact "
"distances or travel times: \"You travel through the forest and find the "
"dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.\" Even in a dungeon, "
"particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can summarize "
"movement between encounters: \"After killing the guardian at the entrance to "
"the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you "
"through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone "
"arch.\"    \n"
"Sometimes it's important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one "
"spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules "
"for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace "
"of the creatures moving and the terrain they're moving over. \n"

"## Speed Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in "
"feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes "
"short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening "
"situation. The following rules determine how far a character or monster can "
"move in a minute, an hour, or a day."

"### Travel Pace \n"
"While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow "
"pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party "
"can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast "
"pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible "
"to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.    \n"
"**Forced March.** The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 "
"hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of "
"exhaustion.    \n"
"For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the "
"distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must "
"make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 "
"for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers "
"one level of exhaustion.    \n"
"**Mounts and Vehicles.** For short spans of time (up to an hour), many "
"animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a "
"gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast "
"pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can "
"cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely "
"populated areas.    \n"
"Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as "
"normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the "
"vessel, and they don't suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits "
"from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships "
"might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.    \n"
"Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, "
"such as a _carpet of flying_, allow you to travel more swiftly.\n"

"### Difficult Terrain \n"
"The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple "
"terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers "
"often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, "
"and ice-covered ground--all considered difficult terrain.    \n"
"You move at half speed in difficult terrain--moving 1 foot in difficult "
"terrain costs 2 feet of speed--so you can cover only half the normal "
"distance in a minute, an hour, or a day. \n"

"## Special Types of Movement Movement through dangerous dungeons or "
"wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might "
"have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go."

msgid ""
"### Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling While climbing or swimming, each foot "
"of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a "
"creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GMâ€™s option, climbing a "
"slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful "
"Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water "
"might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check."

"### Jumping \n"
"Your Strength determines how far you can jump.    \n"
"**Long Jump.** When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to "
"your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before "
"the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that "
"distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of "
"movement.    \n"
"This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a "
"jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM's option, you must succeed on a DC "
"10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a "
"quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you "
"hit it.    \n"
"When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity "
"(Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.    \n"
"**High Jump.** When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of "
"feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on "
"foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you "
"can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the "
"jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow "
"you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally "
"can.    \n"
"You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the "
"jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the "
"jump plus 1 1/2 times your height.\n"
