"## Dexterity Checks \n"
"A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, "
"or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, "
"and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.    "
"\n"
"**Acrobatics.** Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to "
"stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run "
"across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking "
"ship's deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to "
"see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, "
"somersaults, and flips.    \n"
"**Sleight of Hand.** Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual "
"trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object "
"on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also "
"call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can "
"lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another "
"person's pocket.    \n"
"**Stealth.** Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal "
"yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, "
"or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.    \n"
"**Other Dexterity Checks.** The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you "
"try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n"

">#### Hiding \n"
">The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try "
"to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you "
"stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) "
"check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.   "
"\n"
">You can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away "
"your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over "
"a vase. \n"
">An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might "
"still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.   \n"
">In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if "
"you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees "
"you. However, under certain circumstances, the DM might allow you to stay "
"hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain "
"advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.   \n"
">**Passive Perception.** When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice "
"you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature "
"notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that "
"creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the "
"creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If "
"the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For "
"example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a "
"Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a "
"passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.    \n"
">**What Can You See?** One of the main factors in determining whether you "
"can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, "
"which might be **lightly** or **heavily obscured**\n"
