"## Constitution Checks \n"
"Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution "
"checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive "
"rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or "
"monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal "
"limits, however.    \n"
"The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks "
"like the following: \n"

"## Hit Points \n"
"Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you "
"add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit "
"points.    \n"
"If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as "
"well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you "
"raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution "
"modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as "
"though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your "
"first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your "
"new modifier. Or if you're 7th level and some effect lowers your "
"Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit "
"point maximum is reduced by 7.\n"
