"# Saving Throws \n"
"A saving throw--also called a save--represents an attempt to resist a spell, "
"a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don’t normally decide "
"to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or "
"monster is at risk of harm.   \n"
"To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability "
"modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity "
"saving throw.   \n"
"A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be "
"affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM.    \n"
"Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for "
"example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, "
"proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency "
"bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters "
"have saving throw proficiencies as well.    \n"
"The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that "
"causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is "
"determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.    \n"
"The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the "
"effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a "
"creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.\n"
