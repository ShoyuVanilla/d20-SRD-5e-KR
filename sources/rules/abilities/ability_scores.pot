"Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble "
"and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities--a creature's assets as "
"well as weaknesses. The three main rolls of the game--the ability check, the "
"saving throw, and the attack roll--rely on the six ability scores. The "
"book's introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, "
"add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and "
"compare the total to a target number."

"## Ability Scores and Modifiers \n"
"Each of a creature's abilities has a score, a number that defines the "
"magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate "
"capabilities, but also encompasses a creature's training and competence in "
"activities related to that ability.    \n"
"A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many "
"monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the "
"highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high "
"as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.    \n"
"Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 "
"(for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores "
"and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible "
"ability scores, from 1 to 30.\n"
