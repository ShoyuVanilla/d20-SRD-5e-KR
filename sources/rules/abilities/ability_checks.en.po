"# Ability Checks \n"
"An ability check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and training "
"in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an ability check when "
"a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a "
"chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the "
"results.    \n"
"For every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is "
"relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by "
"a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The "
"Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.\n"

"To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability "
"modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare "
"the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability "
"check is a success--the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, "
"it's a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress "
"toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by "
"the GM."

"## Contests \n"
"Sometimes one character's or monster's efforts are directly opposed to "
"another's. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing "
"and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that "
"has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is "
"trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal--for example, when "
"a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding "
"closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special "
"form of ability check, called a contest.   \n"
"Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their "
"efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of "
"comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two "
"checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That "
"character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one "
"from succeeding.   \n"
"If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was "
"before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by "
"default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, "
"neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a "
"door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the "
"door remains shut. \n"

"## Skills \n"
"Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a "
"character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific "
"aspect of an ability score, and an individual's proficiency in a skill "
"demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character's starting skill "
"proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster's skill "
"proficiencies appear in the monster's stat block.)   \n"
"For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character's attempt to pull "
"off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these "
"aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, "
"and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth "
"skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and "
"hiding.   \n"
"The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following "
"list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability's description "
"in the later sections of this section for examples of how to use a skill "
"associated with an ability. \n"

"Sometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill--for "
"example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.” At other times, a player might "
"ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In "
"either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her "
"proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without "
"proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.    \n"
"For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM "
"might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient "
"in Athletics, the character's proficiency bonus is added to the Strength "
"check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a "
"Strength check. \n"

"### Variant: Skills with Different Abilities Normally, your proficiency in a "
"skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in "
"Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some "
"situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different "
"kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual "
"combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply "
"a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an "
"offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check "
"to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM "
"might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a "
"Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you're proficient in Athletics, you "
"apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would "
"normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your "
"half-­‐‑orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, "
"your GM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though "
"Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma."

"## Passive Checks \n"
"A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any "
"die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done "
"repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can "
"be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters "
"succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden "
"monster.    \n"
"Here's how to determine a character's total for a passive check: \n"

" If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, "
"subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a **score**.   \n"
"For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in "
"Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.    \n"
"The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below rely on passive checks, "
"as do the exploration rules. \n"

"## Working Together \n"
"Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character "
"who's leading the effort--or the one with the highest ability modifier--can "
"make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the "
"other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.    \n"
"A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could "
"attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with "
"thieves' tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can't help another "
"character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more "
"individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such "
"as threading a needle, are no easier with help. \n"

"### Group Checks \n"
"When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, "
"the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the "
"characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who "
"aren't.    \n"
"To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability "
"check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds.    \n"
"Otherwise, the group fails. Group checks don't come up very often, and "
"they're most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For "
"example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a "
"group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the "
"quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at "
"least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide "
"their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of "
"these hazards.\n"
