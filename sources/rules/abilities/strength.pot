"## Strength Checks \n"
"A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break "
"something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute "
"force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds "
"of Strength checks.    \n"
"**Athletics.** Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations "
"you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the "
"following activities: \n"

"## Attack Rolls and Damage You add your Strength modifier to your attack "

"a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in "

"## Lifting and Carrying \n"
"Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The "
"following terms define what you can lift or carry.    \n"
"**Carrying Capacity.** Your carrying capacity is your Strength score "
"multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which "
"is high enough that most characters don't usually have to worry about it.   "
"\n"
"**Push, Drag, or Lift.** You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up "
"to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While "
"pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed "
"drops to 5 feet.    \n"
"**Size and Strength.** Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny "
"creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the "
"creature's carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For "
"a Tiny creature, halve these weights. \n"

"## Variant: Encumbrance \n"
"The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a "
"variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a "
"character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, "
"ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.    \n"
"If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are "
"**encumbered**, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.    \n"
"If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your "
"maximum carrying capacity, you are instead **heavily encumbered**, which "
"means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability "
"checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or "
"Constitution.\n"
