"## Charisma Checks \n"
"A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, "
"when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are "
"navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, "
"Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of "
"Charisma checks.   \n"
"**Deception.** Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can "
"convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This "
"deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity "
"to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a "
"guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a "
"disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a "
"straight face while telling a blatant lie.    \n"
"**Intimidation.** When you attempt to influence someone through overt "
"threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to "
"make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry "
"information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a "
"confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering "
"vizier to reconsider a decision.   \n"
"**Performance.** Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you "
"can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some "
"other form of entertainment.   \n"
"**Persuasion.** When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people "
"with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a "
"Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in "
"good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper "
"etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to "
"let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or "
"inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.    \n"
"**Other Charisma Checks.** The GM might call for a Charisma check when you "
"try to accomplish tasks like the following: \n"
