"An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, "
"education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, "
"Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds "
"of Intelligence checks.    \n"
"**Arcana.** Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall "

"**History.** Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to "
"recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, "

"wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a "
"tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in "

"when you try to accomplish tasks like the following: \n"
