"## Wisdom Checks\n"
"A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand "
"someone’s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an "
"injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and "
"Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.    \n"
"**Animal Handling.** When there is any question whether you can calm down a "
"domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an "
"animal’s intentions, the GM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) "
"check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount "
"when you attempt a risky maneuver.    \n"
"**Insight.** Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine "
"the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or "
"predicting someone’s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body "
"language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.    \n"
"**Medicine.** A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying "
"companion or diagnose an illness.   \n"
"**Perception.** Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or "
"otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general "
"awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, "
"you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under "
"an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you "
"might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are "
"orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or "
"candlelight under a closed secret door.   \n"
"**Survival.** The GM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to "
"follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, "
"identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid "
"quicksand and other natural hazards.    \n"
"**Other Wisdom Checks.** The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try "
"to accomplish tasks like the following:\n"
