"# Expenses When not descending into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins "
"for lost treasures, or waging war against the encroaching darkness, "
"adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a fantastical world, people "
"require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These "
"things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others."

"## Lifestyle Expenses \n"
"Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of "
"living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, "
"and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of "
"maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.    "
"\n"
"At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from "
"the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices "
"listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen "
"lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your "
"lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you "
"have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout "
"your character's career.    \n"
"Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle "
"might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the "
"risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid "
"criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.\n"

"**Wretched.** You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, "
"you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, "
"and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched "
"lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow "
"you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and "
"adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are "
"beneath the notice of most people.    \n"
"**Squalid.** You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside "
"town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You "
"have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often "
"violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and "
"misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few "
"legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some "
"terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from "
"disease.    \n"
"**Poor.** A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a "
"stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and "
"unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, "
"experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the "
"common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you "
"still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this "
"lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, "
"thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.    \n"
"**Modest.** A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that "
"you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting "
"a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don't go hungry or thirsty, "
"and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living "
"modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, "
"priests, hedge wizards, and the like.    \n"
"**Comfortable.** Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford "
"nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small "
"cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine "
"inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military "
"officers.    \n"
"**Wealthy.** Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, "
"though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old "
"money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a "
"highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner "
"of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious "
"home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely "
"have a small staff of servants.    \n"
"**Aristocratic.** You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles "
"populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent "
"lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the "
"finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and "
"fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You "
"receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and "
"spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, "
"and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and "
"treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn "
"into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.\n"

"### Self-Sufficiency\n"
"The expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are spending your "
"time between adventures in town, availing yourself of whatever services you "
"can afford--paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your "
"sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, though, might "
"prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in "
"the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.    \n"
"Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn't require you to spend any coin, "
"but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between adventures "
"practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor "
"lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at the equivalent "
"of a comfortable lifestyle.\n"

"## Services \n"
"Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their "
"behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly "
"ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are "
"experts with specialized adventuring skills.    \n"
"Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services "
"table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who "
"inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a "
"specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an "
"elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the secret chest "
"spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A "
"bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming "
"performance in front of the duke.    \n"
"Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary "
"soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are "
"hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a "
"high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might "
"hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan "
"or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings "
"often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the "
"stronghold as part of the offered compensation.\n"

"## Spellcasting Services \n"
"People who are able to cast spells don't fall into the category of ordinary "
"hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a spell in "
"exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay "
"rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the "
"harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs.    \n"
"Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such "
"as **_cure wounds_** or **_identify_**, is easy enough in a city or town, "
"and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material "
"components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level spell "
"might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or "
"prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service "
"instead of payment--the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, "
"such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a "
"monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant "
"settlement.\n"
