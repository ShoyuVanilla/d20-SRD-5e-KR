"# Conditions \n"
"Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can "
"arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other "
"effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such "
"as invisible, can be advantageous.    \n"
"A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is "
"countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the "
"effect that imposed the condition.    \n"
"If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance "
"of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get "
"worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.    \n"
"The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is "
"subjected to a condition. \n"

"### Exhaustion Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as "
"starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, "
"can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in "
"six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, "
"as specified in the effect's description."

"all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has "
"its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.    \n"
"An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the "

"exhaustion level is reduced below 1.    \n"
