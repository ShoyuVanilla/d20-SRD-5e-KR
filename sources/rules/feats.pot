"# Feats \n"
"A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character "
"special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond "
"what a class provides.    \n"
"At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement "
"feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to "
"take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless "
"the feat's description says otherwise.    \n"
"You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you "
"ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain "
"the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a "
"Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 "
"somehow--perhaps by a withering curse--you can't benefit from the Grappler "
"feat until your Strength is restored.\n"
