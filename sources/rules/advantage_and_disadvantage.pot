"# Advantage and Disadvantage \n"
"Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or "
"disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When "
"that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher "
"of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have "
"disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, "
"you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use "
"the 17.    \n"
"If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or "
"imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll more than one additional d20. If "
"two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only "
"one additional d20.    \n"
"If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you "
"are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true "
"even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants "
"advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor "
"disadvantage.    \n"
"When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as "
"the halfling's Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one "
"of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage "
"or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling "
"could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.    \n"
"You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special "
"abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character "
"advantage. The GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one "
"direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a "
"result.\n"
