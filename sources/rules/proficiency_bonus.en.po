"# Proficiency Bonus \n"
"Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have "
"this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in "
"the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.   \n"
"Your proficiency bonus can't be added to a single die roll or other number "
"more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your "
"proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus "
"only once when you make the save.   \n"
"Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled "
"or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue's "
"Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability "
"checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more "
"than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or "
"divide it only once.   \n"
"By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your "
"proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn't normally "
"benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don't add the bonus to the "
"check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that "
"multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack "
"proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that "
"lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) "
"checks.   \n"
"In general, you don't multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or "
"saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules "
"apply.\n"
