"# Inspiration Inspiration is a rule the game master can use to reward you "
"for playing your character in a way that’s true to his or her personality "
"traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration, you can draw on your "
"personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in "
"negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you call on your "
"bond to the defense of your home village to push past the effect of a spell "
"that has been laid on you."

"## Gaining Inspiration Your GM can choose to give you inspiration for a "
"variety of reasons. Typically, GMs award it when you play out your "
"personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, "
"and otherwise portray your character in a compelling way. Your GM will tell "
"you how you can earn inspiration in the game. You either have inspiration or "
"you don’t - you can’t stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use."

"## Using Inspiration If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you "
"make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending your "
"inspiration gives you advantage on that roll. Additionally, if you have "
"inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever "
"thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game. When another "
"player character does something that really contributes to the story in a "
"fun and interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that "
"character inspiration."
