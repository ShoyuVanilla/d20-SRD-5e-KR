"# Movement and Position \n"
"In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using "
"movement and position to gain the upper hand.    \n"
"On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much "
"or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules "
"here.    \n"
"Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different "
"modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your "
"entire move. However you're moving, you deduct the distance of each part of "
"your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done "
"moving. \n"

"## Breaking Up Your Move You can break up your movement on your turn, using "
"some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a "
"speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 "
"feet."

"### Moving between Attacks If you take an action that includes more than one "
"weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between "
"those attacks. For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the "
"Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make "
"an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again."

"### Using Different Speeds \n"
"If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying "
"speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your "
"move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from "
"the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the "
"result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move.    "
"\n"
"For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a "
"wizard cast the fly spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, "
"and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more. \n"

"## Difficult Terrain \n"
"Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless "
"plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous "
"staircases--the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.    \n"
"Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is "
"true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.    \n"
"Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are "
"examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether "
"hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain. \n"

"## Being Prone \n"
"Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they "
"are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they "
"are prone, a condition described in appendix A. You can drop prone without "
"using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an "
"amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is "
"30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can't stand up "
"if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.    \n"
"To move while prone, you must **crawl** or use magic such as "
"teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra "
"foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of\n"
"movement.\n"

"## Moving Around Other Creatures \n"
"You can move through a nonhostile creature's space. In contrast, you can "
"move through a hostile creature's space only if the creature is at least two "
"sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature's space is "
"difficult terrain for you.   \n"
"Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your "
"move in its space.    \n"
"If you leave a hostile creature's reach during your move, you provoke an "
"opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter. \n"

"it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the **_fly_** spell."

"### Space \n"
"A creature's space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in "
"combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium "
"creature isn't 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that "
"wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5‚Äêfoot-wide doorway, other creatures "
"can't get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.    \n"
"A creature's space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For "
"that reason, there's a limit to the number of creatures that can surround "
"another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can "
"fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.    \n"
"Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a "
"creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, "
"there's little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium "
"creatures can surround a Gargantuan one. \n"

"### Squeezing into a Smaller Space A creature can squeeze through a space "
"that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large "
"creature can squeeze through a passage that's only 5 feet wide. While "
"squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot "
"it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving "
"throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it's in the "
"smaller space."
