"# Cover \n"
"Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during "
"combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from "
"cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of "
"the cover.       \n"
"There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of "
"cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't "
"added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives "
"half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has "
"three-quarters cover.    \n"
"A target with **half cover** has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving "
"throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its "
"body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow "
"tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.    "
"\n"
"A target with **three-quarters** cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity "
"saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of "
"it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow "
"slit, or a thick tree trunk.    \n"
"A target with **total cover** can't be targeted directly by an attack or a "
"spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an "
"area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an "
"obstacle.\n"
