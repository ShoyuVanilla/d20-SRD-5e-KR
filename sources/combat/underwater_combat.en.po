"# Underwater Combat \n"
"When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off "
"sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon "
"room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the following "
"rules apply.   \n"
"When making a **melee weapon attack**, a creature that doesn't have a "
"swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the "
"attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or "
"trident.    \n"
"A **ranged weapon attack** automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's "
"normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has "
"disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is "
"thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).    \n"
"Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to "
"fire damage.\n"
