"# Making an Attack Whether you're striking with a melee weapon, firing a "
"weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has "
"a simple structure."

"**1. Choose a target.** Pick a target within your attack's range: a "
"creature, an object, or a location.    \n"
"**2. Determine modifiers.** The GM determines whether the target has cover "
"and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In "
"addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties "
"or bonuses to your attack roll.    \n"
"**3. Resolve the attack.** You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll "
"damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some "
"attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.    \n"

"## Attack Rolls When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether "
"the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the "
"appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or "
"exceeds the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a "
"character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster "
"is in its stat block."

"### Modifiers to the Roll \n"
"When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the "
"roll are an ability modifier and the character's proficiency bonus. When a "
"monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its "
"stat block.   \n"
"**Ability Modifier.** The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is "
"Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is "
"Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this "
"rule.    \n"
"Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a "
"spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.    \n"
"**Proficiency Bonus.** You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll "
"when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as "
"when you attack with a spell. \n"

"### Rolling 1 or 20 \n"
"Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and "
"the veteran to miss.    \n"
"If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any "
"modifiers or the target's AC. This is called a critical hit, which is "
"explained later in this chapter.    \n"
"If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any "
"modifiers or the target's AC. \n"

"## Unseen Attackers and Targets \n"
"Combatants often try to escape their foes' notice by hiding, casting the "
"invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness.    \n"
"When you attack a target that you can't see, you have disadvantage on the "
"attack roll. This is true whether you're guessing the target's location or "
"you're targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in "
"the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just "
"says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target's location "
"correctly.    \n"
"When a creature can't see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against "
"it. If you are hidden--both unseen and unheard--when you make an attack, you "
"give away your location when the attack hits or misses.\n"

"## Ranged Attacks When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a "
"crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a "
"distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also "
"involve making a ranged attack."

"### Range \n"
"You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.    "
"\n"
"If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you "
"can't attack a target beyond this range.    \n"
"Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have "
"two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is "
"the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond "
"normal range, and you can't attack a target beyond the long range. \n"

"### Ranged Attacks in Close Combat Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult "
"when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a "
"spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you "
"are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn't "
"incapacitated."

"## Melee Attacks \n"
"Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe "
"within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a "
"sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when "
"it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A "
"few spells also involve making a melee attack.   \n"
"Most creatures have a 5-foot **reach** and can thus attack targets within 5 "
"feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those "
"larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as "
"noted in their descriptions.    \n"
"Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an "
"**unarmed strike**: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none "
"of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning "
"damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your "
"unarmed strikes. \n"

"### Opportunity Attacks \n"
"In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy "
"who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity "
"attack.    \n"
"You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see "
"moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your "
"reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack "
"occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.    \n"
"You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage "
"action. You also don't provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or "
"when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or "
"reaction. For example, you don't provoke an opportunity attack if an "
"explosion hurls you out of a foe's reach or if gravity causes you to fall "
"past an enemy.    \n"

"### Two-Weapon Fighting \n"
"When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that "
"you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a "
"different light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand. You "
"don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless "
"that modifier is negative.    \n"
"If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead "
"of making a melee attack with it. \n"

"> ### Contests in Combat > Battle often involves pitting your prowess "
"against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This "
"section includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: "
"grappling and shoving a creature. The GM can use these contests as models "
"for improvising others."

"### Grappling \n"
"When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack "
"action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you're able to make "
"multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.    "
"\n"
"The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and "
"must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize "
"the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength "
"(Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or "
"Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you "
"succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition. The condition "
"specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever "
"you like (no action required).    \n"
"**Escaping a Grapple.** A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To "
"do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) "
"check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.   \n"
"**Moving a Grappled Creature.** When you move, you can drag or carry the "
"grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is "
"two or more sizes smaller than you.    \n"

"### Shoving a Creature \n"
"Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a "
"creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you're able "
"to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of "
"them.    \n"
"The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within "
"your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength "
"(Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or "
"Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you "
"win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away "
"from you. \n"
