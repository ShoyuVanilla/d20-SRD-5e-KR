"# Languages \n"
"Your race indicates the languages your character can speak by default, and "
"your background might give you access to one or more additional languages of "
"your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet.   \n"
"Choose your languages from the Standard Languages table, or choose one that "
"is common in your campaign. With your GM's permission, you can instead "
"choose a language from the Exotic Languages table or a secret language, such "
"as thieves' cant or the tongue of druids.    \n"
"Some of these languages are actually families of languages with many "
"dialects. For example, the Primordial language includes the Auran, Aquan, "
"Ignan, and Terran dialects, one for each of the four elemental "
"planes. Creatures that speak different dialects of the same language can "
"communicate with one another.\n"
