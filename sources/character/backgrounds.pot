"# Backgrounds \n"
"Every story has a beginning. Your character's background reveals where you "
"came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your "
"fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your "
"wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by "
"as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.    \n"
"Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your "
"character's identity. The most important question to ask about your "
"background is **what changed**? Why did you stop doing whatever your "
"background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to "
"purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why "
"don't you have **more** money? How did you learn the skills of your class? "
"What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?    \n"
"The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete benefits "
"(features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions. \n"

"### Proficiencies \n"
"Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills.   \n"
"In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more "
"tools.    \n"
"If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, "
"he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or "
"tool) instead. \n"

"### Languages Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional "
"languages beyond those given by race."

"### Equipment Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If "
"you use the optional rule to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the "
"starting equipment from your background."

msgid ""
"### Suggested Characteristics A background contains suggested personal "
"characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll "
"dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for "
"characteristics of your own creation. Customizing a Background You might "
"want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your "
"character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can "
"replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a "
"total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample "
"backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background "
"or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment section. (If you spend "
"coin, you can't also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) "
"Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one "
"flaw. If you can't find a feature that matches your desired background, work "
"with your GM to create one."

"## Acolyte \n"
"You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or "
"pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy "
"and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in "
"order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not "
"necessarily a cleric - performing sacred rites is not the same thing as "
"channeling divine power.    \n"
"Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being from "
"among those listed in \"Fantasy--Historical Pantheons\" or those specified "
"by your GM, and work with your GM to detail the nature of your religious "
"service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to "
"assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who "
"suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps "
"you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple "
"structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you "
"now deny. \n"

"### Feature: Shelter of the Faithful \n"
"As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and "
"you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your "
"adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a "
"temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must "
"provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your "
"religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.    \n"
"You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity "
"or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where "
"you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where "
"you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the "
"priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous "
"and you remain in good standing with your temple. \n"

"### Suggested Characteristics Acolytes are shaped by their experience in "
"temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and "
"tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or "
"hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some "
"hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme."
