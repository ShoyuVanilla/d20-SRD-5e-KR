"2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can "
"include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare "
"the 1st-level spell **_cure wounds_**, you can cast it using a 1st-level or "
"2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of "
"prepared spells.   \n"
"You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long "

">##### Sacred Plants and Wood \n"
">A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, "
"elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids "
"often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths "
"of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.   \n"
">Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons "
"and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for "
"scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life "
"and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, "
"such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with "
"air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.   "
"\n"
">Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other "
"plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region "
"might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.\n"

"peoples."
