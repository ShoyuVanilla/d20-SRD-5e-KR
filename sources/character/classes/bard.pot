"hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members "
"might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from "
"their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the "
"king.  The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, "
"not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who "
"keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be "
"honest than politic.  The college's members gather in libraries and "
"sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to "
"share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of "
