"# Nonplayer Characters \n"
"## Customizing NPCs \n"
"There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs for your home campaign.    \n"
"**Racial Traits.** You can add racial traits to an NPC. For example, a "
"halfling druid might have a speed of 25 feet and the Lucky trait. Adding "
"racial traits to an NPC doesn't alter its challenge rating. For more on "
"racial traits, see the Player's Handbook.    \n"
"**Spell Swaps.** One way to customize an NPC spellcaster is to replace one "
"or more of its spells. You can substitute any spell on the NPC's spell list "
"with a different spell of the same level from the same spell list. Swapping "
"spells in this manner doesn't alter an NPC's challenge rating.    \n"
"**Armor and Weapon Swaps.** You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC's armor, or "
"add or switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage can change an "
"NPC's challenge rating.    \n"
"**Magic Items.** The more powerful an NPC, the more likely it has one or "
"more magic items in its possession. An archmage, for example, might have a "
"magic staff or wand, as well as one or more potions and scrolls. Giving an "
"NPC a potent damage-dealing magic item could alter its challenge rating.\n"
