"# Poisons \n"
"Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most "
"societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, drow, and other evil "
"creatures.    \n"
"Poisons come in the following four types.    \n"
"**Contact.** Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent "
"until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison "
"with exposed skin suffers its effects.    \n"
"**Ingested.** A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to "
"suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may "
"decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage "
"on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.    \n"
"**Inhaled.** These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when "
"inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a "
"5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately "
"afterward. Holding one's breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as "
"they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.   \n"
"**Injury.** Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap "
"components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and "
"remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature "
"that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison "
"is exposed to its effects. \n"

"## Sample Poisons \n"
"Each type of poison has its own debilitating effects.    \n"
"**Assassin's Blood (Ingested).** A creature subjected to this poison must "
"make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 6 (1d12) "
"poison damage and is poisoned for 24 hours. On a successful save, the "
"creature takes half damage and isn't poisoned.    \n"
"**Burnt Othur Fumes (Inhaled).** A creature subjected to this poison must "
"succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage, "
"and must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On each "
"successive failed save, the character takes 3 (1d6) poison damage. After "
"three successful saves, the poison ends.    \n"
"**Crawler Mucus (Contact).** This poison must be harvested from a dead or "
"incapacitated crawler. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a "
"DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned "
"creature is paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end "
"of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.    \n"
"**Drow Poison (Injury).** This poison is typically made only by the drow, "
"and only in a place far removed from sunlight. A creature subjected to this "
"poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for "
"1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also "
"unconscious while poisoned in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes "
"damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.    \n"
"**Essence of Ether (Inhaled).** A creature subjected to this poison must "
"succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 8 "
"hours. The poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if it "
"takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.    \n"
"**Malice (Inhaled).** A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a "
"DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned "
"creature is blinded.    \n"
"**Midnight Tears (Ingested).** A creature that ingests this poison suffers "
"no effect until the stroke of midnight. If the poison has not been "
"neutralized before then, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution "
"saving throw, taking 31 (9d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as "
"much damage on a successful one.    \n"
"**Oil of Taggit (Contact).** A creature subjected to this poison must "
"succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 24 "
"hours. The poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if it "
"takes damage.    \n"
"**Pale Tincture (Ingested).** A creature subjected to this poison must "
"succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) poison damage "
"and become poisoned. The poisoned creature must repeat the saving throw "
"every 24 hours, taking 3 (1d6) poison damage on a failed save. Until this "
"poison ends, the damage the poison deals can't be healed by any means. After "
"seven successful saving throws, the effect ends and the creature can heal "
"normally.    \n"
"**Purple Worm Poison (Injury).** This poison must be harvested from a dead "
"or incapacitated purple worm. A creature subjected to this poison must make "
"a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) poison damage on a "
"failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.    \n"
"**Serpent Venom (Injury).** This poison must be harvested from a dead or "
"incapacitated giant poisonous snake. A creature subjected to this poison "
"must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison "
"damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.    \n"
"**Torpor (Ingested).** A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a "
"DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 4d6 hours. The "
"poisoned creature is incapacitated.    \n"
"**Truth Serum (Ingested).** A creature subjected to this poison must succeed "
"on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The "
"poisoned creature can't knowingly speak a lie, as if under the effect of a "
"zone of truth spell.    \n"
"**Wyvern Poison (Injury).** This poison must be harvested from a dead or "
"incapacitated wyvern. A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 15 "
"Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a failed save, "
"or half as much damage on a successful one.\n"
