"### Actions \n"
"**Longsword.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one "
"target. _Hit:_ 1 slashing damage.    \n"
"**Shortbow.** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, range 40/160 ft., one "
"target. _Hit:_ 1 piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 "
"Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. If its saving "
"throw result is 5 or lower, the poisoned target falls unconscious for the "
"same duration, or until it takes damage or another creature takes an action "
"to shake it awake.    \n"
"**Heart Sight.** The sprite touches a creature and magically knows the "
"creature's current emotional state. If the target fails a DC 10 Charisma "
"saving throw, the sprite also knows the creature's alignment. Celestials, "
"fiends, and undead automatically fail the saving throw.    \n"
"**Invisibility.** The sprite magically turns invisible until it attacks or "
"casts a spell, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a "
"spell). Any equipment the sprite wears or carries is invisible with it.\n"
