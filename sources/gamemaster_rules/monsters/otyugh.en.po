"### Actions \n"
"**Multiattack.** The otyugh makes three attacks: one with its bite and two "
"with its tentacles.    \n"
"**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed "
"on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against disease or become poisoned "
"until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must "
"repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a "
"failure. The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease "
"reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point "
"maximum lasts until the disease is cured.    \n"
"**Tentacle.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one "
"target. _Hit:_ 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) piercing "
"damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 13) "
"and restrained until the grapple ends. The otyugh has two tentacles, each of "
"which can grapple one target.    \n"
"**Tentacle Slam.** The otyugh slams creatures grappled by it into each other "
"or a solid surface. Each creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution "
"saving throw or take 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and be stunned until "
"the end of the otyugh's next turn. On a successful save, the target takes "
"half the bludgeoning damage and isn't stunned.\n"
