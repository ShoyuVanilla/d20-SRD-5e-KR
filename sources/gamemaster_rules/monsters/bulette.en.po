"### Actions \n"
"**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"30 (4d12 + 4) piercing damage.    \n"
"**Deadly Leap.** If the bulette jumps at least 15 feet as part of its "
"movement, it can then use this action to land on its feet in a space that "
"contains one or more other creatures. Each of those creatures must succeed "
"on a DC 16 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (target's choice) or be "
"knocked prone and take 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (3d6 + 4) "
"slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes only half the "
"damage, isn't knocked prone, and is pushed 5 feet out of the bulette's space "
"into an unoccupied space of the creature's choice. If no unoccupied space is "
"within range, the creature instead falls prone in the bulette's space.\n"
