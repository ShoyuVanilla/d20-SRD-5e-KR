"ft., one target. _Hit:_ 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must "
"succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (2d4) poison damage "
"and become poisoned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at "
"the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.    "
"\n"
"**Scare (1/Day).** One creature of the quasit's choice within 20 feet of it "
"must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 "
"minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its "
"turns, with disadvantage if the quasit is within line of sight, ending the "
"effect on itself on a success.    \n"
"**Invisibility.** The quasit magically turns invisible until it attacks or "
"uses Scare, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a "
"spell). Any equipment the quasit wears or carries is invisible with it.\n"
