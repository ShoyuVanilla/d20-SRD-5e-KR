"**Multiattack.** The tarrasque can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes "
"five attacks: one with its bite, two with its claws, one with its horns, and "
"one with its tail. It can use its Swallow instead of its bite.   \n"
"**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one "
"target. _Hit:_ 36 (4d12 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, "
"it is grappled (escape DC 20). Until this grapple ends, the target is "
"restrained, and the tarrasque can't bite another target.   \n"
"**Claw.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +19 to hit, reach 15ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"28 (4d8 + 10) slashing damage.   \n"
"**Horns.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +19 to hit, reach 10ft., one "
"target. _Hit:_ 32 (4d10 + 10) piercing damage.   \n"
"**Tail.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +19 to hit, reach 20ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"24 (4d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must "
"succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.   \n"
"**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the tarrasque's choice within 120 "
"feet of it and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or "
"become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at "
"the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the tarrasque is within "
"line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's "
"saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune "
"to the tarrasque's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.   \n"
"**Swallow.** The tarrasque makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller "
"creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's "
"damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the "
"creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and "
"other effects outside the tarrasque, and it takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at "
"the start of each of the tarrasque's turns.    \n"
"If the tarrasque takes 60 damage or more on a single turn from a creature "
"inside it, the tarrasque must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw "
"at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall "
"prone in a space within 10 feet of the tarrasque. If the tarrasque dies, a "
"swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the "
"corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.   \n"
