"**Shapechanger.** The wereboar can use its action to polymorph into a "
"boar-humanoid hybrid or into a boar, or back into its true form, which is "
"humanoid. Its statistics, other than its AC, are the same in each form. Any "
"equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its "
"true form if it dies.    \n"
"**Charge (Boar or Hybrid Form Only).** If the wereboar moves at least 15 "
"feet straight toward a target and then hits it with its tusks on the same "
"turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) slashing damage. If the target is a "
"creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked "
"prone.    \n"
"**Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** If the wereboar takes "
"14 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 "
"hit point instead. \n"
