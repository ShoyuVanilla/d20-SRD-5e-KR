"**Petrifying Gaze.** When a creature that can see the medusa's eyes starts "
"its turn within 30 feet of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC "
"14 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn't incapacitated and can see "
"the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is "
"instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to "
"turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the "
"saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or "
"ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature "
"is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.    \n"
"Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at "
"the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the medusa "
"until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the "
"creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the "
"save.    \n"
"If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of "
"it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due to its curse, affected "
"by its own gaze. \n"
