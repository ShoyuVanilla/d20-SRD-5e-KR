"### Actions \n"
"**Enlarge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** For 1 minute, the "
"duergar magically increases in size, along with anything it is wearing or "
"carrying. While enlarged, the duergar is Large, doubles its damage dice on "
"Strength-based weapon attacks (included in the attacks), and makes Strength "
"checks and Strength saving throws with advantage. If the duergar lacks the "
"room to become Large, it attains the maximum size possible in the space "
"available.    \n"
"**War Pick.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one "
"target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage, or 11 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage "
"while enlarged.    \n"
"**Javelin.** _Melee or _Ranged Weapon Attack:__ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or "
"range 30/120 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage, or 9 (2d6 "
"+ 2) piercing damage while enlarged.    \n"
"**Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The duergar "
"magically turns invisible until it attacks, casts a spell, or uses its "
"Enlarge, or until its concentration is broken, up to 1 hour (as if "
"concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the duergar wears or carries is "
"invisible with it.\n"
