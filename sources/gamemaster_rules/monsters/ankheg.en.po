"### Actions \n"
"**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) acid damage. If the target is a "
"Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple "
"ends, the ankheg can bite only the grappled creature and has advantage on "
"attack rolls to do so.    \n"
"**Acid Spray (Recharge 6).** The ankheg spits acid in a line that is 30 feet "
"long and 5 feet wide, provided that it has no creature grappled. Each "
"creature in that line must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 "
"(3d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful "
"one. \n"
