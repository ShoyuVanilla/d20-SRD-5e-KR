"**Hold Breath.** The hydra can hold its breath for 1 hour.    \n"
"**Multiple Heads.** The hydra has five heads. While it has more than one "
"head, the hydra has advantage on saving throws against being blinded, "
"charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious.    \n"
"Whenever the hydra takes 25 or more damage in a single turn, one of its "
"heads dies. If all its heads die, the hydra dies.    \n"
"At the end of its turn, it grows two heads for each of its heads that died "
"since its last turn, unless it has taken fire damage since its last "
"turn. The hydra regains 10 hit points for each head regrown in this way.    "
"\n"
"**Reactive Heads.** For each head the hydra has beyond one, it gets an extra "
"reaction that can be used only for opportunity attacks.    \n"
"**Wakeful.** While the hydra sleeps, at least one of its heads is awake. \n"
