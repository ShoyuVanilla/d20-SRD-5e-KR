"### Actions    \n"
"**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one "
"creature. _Hit:_ 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC "
"11 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) poison damage on a failed save, "
"or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the "
"target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even "
"after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.    "
"\n"
"**Web (Recharge 5–6).** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, range 30/60 ft., "
"one creature. _Hit:_ The target is restrained by webbing. As an action, the "
"restrained target can make a DC 12 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a "
"success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; "
"vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic "
"damage). \n"

"### Description To snare its prey, a giant spider spins elaborate webs or "
"shoots sticky strands of webbing from its abdomen. Giant spiders are most "
"commonly found underground, making their lairs on ceilings or in dark, "
"web-filled crevices. Such lairs are often festooned with web cocoons holding "
"past victims."
