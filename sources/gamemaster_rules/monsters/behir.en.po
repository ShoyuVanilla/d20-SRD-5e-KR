"### Actions \n"
"**Multiattack.** The behir makes two attacks: one with its bite and one to "
"constrict.    \n"
"**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one "
"target. _Hit:_ 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage.    \n"
"**Constrict.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Large or "
"smaller creature. _Hit:_ 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 17 (2d10 + 6) "
"slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 16) if the behir isn't "
"already constricting a creature, and the target is restrained until this "
"grapple ends.    \n"
"**Lightning Breath (Recharge 5â€“6).** The behir exhales a line of lightning "
"that is 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a "
"DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed "
"save, or half as much damage on a successful one.    \n"
"**Swallow.** The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller "
"target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, "
"and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, "
"it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the behir, and "
"it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the behir's turns. A "
"behir can have only one creature swallowed at a time.    \n"
"If the behir takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed "
"creature, the behir must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the "
"end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space "
"within 10 feet of the behir. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no "
"longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of "
"movement, exiting prone.\n"
