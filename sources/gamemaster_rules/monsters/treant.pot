"**Multiattack.** The treant makes two slam attacks.    \n"
"**Slam.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"16 (3d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage.   \n"

"**Animate Trees (1/Day).** The treant magically animates one or two trees it "
"can see within 60 feet of it. These trees have the same statistics as a "
"treant, except they have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, they can't "
"speak, and they have only the Slam action option. An animated tree acts as "
"an ally of the treant. The tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies; "
"until the treant dies or is more than 120 feet from the tree; or until the "
"treant takes a bonus action to turn it back into an inanimate tree. The tree "
"then takes root if possible.\n"
