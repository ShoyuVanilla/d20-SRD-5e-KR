"### Actions \n"
"**Multiattack.** The harpy makes two attacks: one with its claws and one "
"with its club.    \n"
"**Claws.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"6 (2d4 + 1) slashing damage.    \n"
"**Club.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"3 (1d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage.    \n"
"**Luring Song.** The harpy sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant "
"within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 11 "
"Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must take a "
"bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop "
"singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is incapacitated.    \n"
"While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs "
"of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the "
"harpy, the target must move on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct "
"route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, "
"but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever "
"it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, the target can repeat "
"the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the "
"end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends "
"on it.    \n"
"A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy's song for the next "
"24 hours.\n"
