"### Actions \n"
"**Multiattack.** The kraken makes three tentacle attacks, each of which it "
"can replace with one use of Fling.    \n"
"**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +17 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"23 (3d8 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature "
"grappled by the kraken, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple "
"ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total "
"cover against attacks and other effects outside the kraken, and it takes 42 "
"(12d6) acid damage at the start of each of the kraken's turns.    \n"
"If the kraken takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature "
"inside it, the kraken must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at "
"the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall "
"prone in a space within 10 feet of the kraken. If the kraken dies, a "
"swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the "
"corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.    \n"
"**Tentacle.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +17 to hit, reach 30 ft., one "
"target. _Hit:_ 20 (3d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled "
"(escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The "
"kraken has ten tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.    \n"
"**Fling.** One Large or smaller object held or creature grappled by the "
"kraken is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If a "
"thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning "
"damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another "
"creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or "
"take the same damage and be knocked prone.    \n"
"**Lightning Storm.** The kraken magically creates three bolts of lightning, "
"each of which can strike a target the kraken can see within 120 feet of "
"it. A target must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) "
"lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful "
"one. \n"

"### Legendary Actions \n"
"The kraken can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options "
"below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at "
"the end of another creature's turn. The kraken regains spent legendary "
"actions at the start of its turn.    \n"
"**Tentacle Attack or Fling.** The kraken makes one tentacle attack or uses "
"its Fling.    \n"
"**Lightning Storm (Costs 2 Actions).** The kraken uses Lightning Storm.    "
"\n"
"**Ink Cloud (Costs 3 Actions).** While underwater, the kraken expels an ink "
"cloud in a 60-foot radius. The cloud spreads around corners, and that area "
"is heavily obscured to creatures other than the kraken. Each creature other "
"than the kraken that ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 23 "
"Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) poison damage on a failed save, "
"or half as much damage on a successful one. A strong current disperses the "
"cloud, which otherwise disappears at the end of the kraken's next turn.\n"
