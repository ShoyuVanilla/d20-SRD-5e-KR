"**Acid Absorption.** Whenever the golem is subjected to acid damage, it "
"takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the acid "
"damage dealt.    \n"
"**Berserk.** Whenever the golem starts its turn with 60 hit points or fewer, "
"roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns while "
"berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature "
"is near enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with "
"preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, "
"it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.    "

"### Actions \n"
"**Multiattack.** The golem makes two slam attacks.    \n"
"**Slam.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must "
"succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum "
"reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. The target dies if this "
"attack reduces its hit point maximum to 0. The reduction lasts until removed "
"by the greater restoration spell or other magic.    \n"
"**Haste (Recharge 5–6).** Until the end of its next turn, the golem "
"magically gains a +2 bonus to its AC, has advantage on Dexterity saving "
"throws, and can use its slam attack as a bonus action.\n"
