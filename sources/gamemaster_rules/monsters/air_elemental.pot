"### Actions \n"
"**Multiattack.** The elemental makes two slam attacks.    \n"
"**Slam.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.    \n"
"**Whirlwind (Recharge 4–6).** Each creature in the elemental's space must "
"make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 15 (3d8 + "
"2) bludgeoning damage and is flung up 20 feet away from the elemental in a "
"random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes an object, "
"such as a wall or floor, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for "
"every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, "
"that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take the "
"same damage and be knocked prone.    \n"
"If the saving throw is successful, the target takes half the bludgeoning "
"damage and isn't flung away or knocked prone.\n"
