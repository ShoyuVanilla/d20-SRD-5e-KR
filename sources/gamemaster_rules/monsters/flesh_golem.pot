"**Berserk.** Whenever the golem starts its turn with 40 hit points or fewer, "
"roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns while "
"berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature "
"is near enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with "
"preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, "
"it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.    "
"\n"
"The golem's creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem, can try to calm "
"it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must be able to hear its "
"creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) "
"check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases being berserk. If it takes "
"damage while still at 40 hit points or fewer, the golem might go berserk "
"again.    \n"
"**Aversion of Fire.** If the golem takes fire damage, it has disadvantage on "
"attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.    \n"
"**Immutable Form.** The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would "
"alter its form.     \n"
"**Lightning Absorption.** Whenever the golem is subjected to lightning "
"damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal "
"to the lightning damage dealt.    \n"
"**Magic Resistance.** The golem has advantage on saving throws against "
"spells and other magical effects.    \n"
"**Magic Weapons.** The golem's weapon attacks are magical.\n"
