"### Actions \n"
"**Multiattack.** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes "
"three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.    \n"
"**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one "
"target. _Hit:_ 18 (2d10 + 7) piercing damage.    \n"
"**Claw.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage.    \n"
"**Tail.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one "
"target. _Hit:_ 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.    \n"
"**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within "
"120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving "
"throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving "
"throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a "
"success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for "
"it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next "
"24 hours.    \n"
"**Breath Weapons (Recharge 5–6).** The dragon uses one of the following "
"breath weapons.    \n"
"**Lightning Breath.** The dragon exhales lightning in a 90- foot line that "
"is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 19 Dexterity "
"saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half "
"as much damage on a successful one.    \n"
"**Repulsion Breath.** The dragon exhales repulsion energy in a 30-foot "
"cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving "
"throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 60 feet away from the "
"dragon.    \n"
"**Change Shape.** The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast "
"that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true "
"form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or "
"carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon's choice).    \n"
"In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, "
"ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and "
"Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its "
"statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, "
"except any class features or legendary actions of that form. \n"

"actions at the start of its turn.    \n"
"**Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.    \n"
"**Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.    \n"

"within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw "
"or take 14 (2d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can "
"then fly up to half its flying speed.\n"
