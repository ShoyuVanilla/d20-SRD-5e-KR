"### Actions \n"
"**Multiattack.** The worm makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with "
"its stinger.    \n"
"**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"22 (3d8 + 9) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, "
"it must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the "
"worm. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover "
"against attacks and other effects outside the worm, and it takes 21 (6d6) "
"acid damage at the start of each of the worm's turns.    \n"
"If the worm takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside "
"it, the worm must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at the end of "
"that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a "
"space within 10 feet of the worm. If the worm dies, a swallowed creature is "
"no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet "
"of movement, exiting prone.    \n"
"**Tail Stinger.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one "
"creature. _Hit:_ 19 (3d6 + 9) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC "
"19 Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) poison damage on a failed "
"save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n"
