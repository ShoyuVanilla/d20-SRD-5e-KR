"### Description A death dog is an ugly two-headed hound that roams plains, "
"and deserts. Hate burns in a death dog's heart, and a taste for humanoid "
"flesh drives it to attack travelers and explorers. Death dog saliva carries "
"a foul disease that causes a victim's flesh to slowly rot off the bone."
