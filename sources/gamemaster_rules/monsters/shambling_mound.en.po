"### Actions \n"
"**Multiattack.** The shambling mound makes two slam attacks. If both attacks "
"hit a Medium or smaller target, the target is grappled (escape DC 14), and "
"the shambling mound uses its Engulf on it.    \n"
"**Slam.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.    \n"
"**Engulf.** The shambling mound engulfs a Medium or smaller creature "
"grappled by it. The engulfed target is blinded, restrained, and unable to "
"breathe, and it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the "
"start of each of the mound's turns or take 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning "
"damage. If the mound moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The mound can "
"have only one creature engulfed at a time.\n"
