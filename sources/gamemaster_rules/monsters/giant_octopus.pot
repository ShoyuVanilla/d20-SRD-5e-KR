"### Actions \n"
"**Tentacles.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 15 ft., one "
"target. _Hit:_ 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, "
"it is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is "
"restrained, and the octopus can't use its tentacles on another target.    \n"
"**Ink Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** A 20- foot-radius "
"cloud of ink extends all around the octopus if it is underwater. The area is "
"heavily obscured for 1 minute, although a significant current can disperse "
"the ink. After releasing the ink, the octopus can use the Dash action as a "
"bonus action. \n"
