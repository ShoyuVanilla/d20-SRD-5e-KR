"### Description The arctic-dwelling winter wolf is as large as a dire wolf "
"but has snow-white fur and pale blue eyes. Frost giants use these evil "
"creatures as guards and hunting companions, putting the wolves' deadly "
"breath weapon to use against their foes. Winter wolves communicate with one "
"another using growls and barks, but they speak Common and Giant well enough "
"to follow simple conversations."
