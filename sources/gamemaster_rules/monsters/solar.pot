"### Actions \n"
"**Multiattack.** The solar makes two greatsword attacks.    \n"
"**Greatsword.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one "
"target. _Hit:_ 22 (4d6 + 8) slashing damage plus 27 (6d8) radiant damage.    "
"\n"
"**Slaying Longbow.** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit, range 150/600 ft., "
"one target. _Hit:_ 15 (2d8 + 6) piercing damage plus 27 (6d8) radiant "
"damage. If the target is a creature that has 100 hit points or fewer, it "
"must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or die.   \n"
"**Flying Sword.** The solar releases its greatsword to hover magically in an "
"unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. If the solar can see the sword, the "
"solar can mentally command it as a bonus action to fly up to 50 feet and "
"either make one attack against a target or return to the solar's hands. If "
"the hovering sword is targeted by any effect, the solar is considered to be "
"holding it. The hovering sword falls if the solar dies.   \n"
"**Healing Touch (4/Day).** The solar touches another creature. The target "
"magically regains 40 (8d8 + 4) hit points and is freed from any curse, "

"damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.    \n"
