"### Description A giant fire beetle is a nocturnal creature that takes its "
"name from a pair of glowing glands that give off light. Miners and "
"adventurers prize these creatures, for a giant fire beetle's glands continue "
"to shed light for 1d6 days after the beetle dies. Giant fire beetles are "
"most commonly found underground and in dark forests."
