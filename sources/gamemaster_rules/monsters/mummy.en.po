"### Actions \n"
"**Multiattack.** The mummy can use its Dreadful Glare and makes one attack "
"with its rotting fist.    \n"
"**Rotting Fist.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one "
"target. _Hit:_ 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic "
"damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution "
"saving throw or be cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can't regain hit "
"points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours "
"that elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the "
"target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by "
"the remove curse spell or other magic.    \n"
"**Dreadful Glare.** The mummy targets one creature it can see within 60 feet "
"of it. If the target can see the mummy, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom "
"saving throw against this magic or become frightened until the end of the "
"mummy's next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is "
"also paralyzed for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving "
"throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies (but not mummy lords) "
"for the next 24 hours.\n"
