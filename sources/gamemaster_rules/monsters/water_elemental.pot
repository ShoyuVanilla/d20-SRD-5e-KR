"**Multiattack.** The elemental makes two slam attacks.    \n"
"**Slam.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.    \n"
"**Whelm (Recharge 4–6).** Each creature in the elemental's space must make a "
"DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 13 (2d8 + 4) "
"bludgeoning damage. If it is Large or smaller, it is also grappled (escape "
"DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and unable to "
"breathe unless it can breathe water. If the saving throw is successful, the "
"target is pushed out of the elemental's space.    \n"
"The elemental can grapple one Large creature or up to two Medium or smaller "
"creatures at one time. At the start of each of the elemental's turns, each "
"target grappled by it takes 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. A creature "
"within 5 feet of the elemental can pull a creature or object out of it by "
"taking an action to make a DC 14 Strength and succeeding.\n"
