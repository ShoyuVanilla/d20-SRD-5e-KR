"**Tentacles.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one "
"target. _Hit:_ 1 bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC "
"10). Until this grapple ends, the octopus can't use its tentacles on another "
"target.    \n"

"of ink extends all around the octopus if it is underwater. The area is "

"the ink. After releasing the ink, the octopus can use the Dash action as a "
"bonus action. \n"
