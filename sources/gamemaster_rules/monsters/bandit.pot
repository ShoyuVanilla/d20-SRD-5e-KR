"### Description Bandits rove in gangs and are sometimes led by thugs, "
"veterans, or spellcasters. Not all bandits are evil. Oppression, drought, "
"disease, or famine can often drive otherwise honest folk to a life of "
"banditry. Pirates are bandits of the high seas. They might be freebooters "
"interested only in treasure and murder, or they might be privateers "
"sanctioned by the crown to attack and plunder an enemy nation's vessels."
