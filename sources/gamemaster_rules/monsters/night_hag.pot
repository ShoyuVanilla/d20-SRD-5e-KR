"### Actions    \n"
"**Claws (Hag Form Only).** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., "
"one target. _Hit:_ 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.    \n"
"**Change Shape.** The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female "
"humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each "
"form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She "
"reverts to her true form if she dies.    \n"
"**Etherealness.** The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the "
"Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a heartstone in "
"her possession.    \n"
"**Nightmare Haunting (1/Day).** While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag "
"magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A protection "
"from evil and good spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a "
"magic circle. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful "
"visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no "
"benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If "
"this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, "
"and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag's soul bag. The "
"reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until removed by the "
"greater restoration spell or similar magic.\n"
