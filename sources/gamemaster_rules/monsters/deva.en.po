"### Actions \n"
"**Multiattack.** The deva makes two melee attacks.    \n"
"**Mace.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) radiant damage.    \n"
"**Healing Touch (3/Day).** The deva touches another creature. The target "
"magically regains 20 (4d8 + 2) hit points and is freed from any curse, "
"disease, poison, blindness, or deafness.    \n"
"**Change Shape.** The deva magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast "
"that has a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back into its "
"true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is "
"wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the deva's "
"choice).    \n"
"In a new form, the deva retains its game statistics and ability to speak, "
"but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and special senses are "
"replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and "
"capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) "
"that the new form has but that it lacks.\n"
