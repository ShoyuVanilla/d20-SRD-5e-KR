"### Variant: Diseased Giant Rats \n"
"Some giant rats carry vile diseases that they spread with their bites. A "
"diseased giant rat has a challenge rating of 1/8 (25 XP) and the following "
"action instead of its normal bite attack.     \n"
"**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on "
"a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease. Until the disease "
"is cured, the target can't regain hit points except by magical means, and "
"the target's hit point maximum decreases by 3 (1d6) every 24 hours. If the "
"target's hit point maximum drops to 0 as a result of this disease, the "
"target dies. \n"
