"### Actions \n"
"**Multiattack.** The vrock makes two attacks: one with its beak and one with "
"its talons.    \n"
"**Beak.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage.    \n"
"**Talons.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one "
"target. _Hit:_ 14 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage.    \n"
"**Spores (Recharge 6).** A 15­‐foot­‐radius cloud of toxic spores extends "
"out from the vrock. The spores spread around corners. Each creature in that "
"area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become "
"poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a target takes 5 (1d10) poison damage "
"at the start of each of its turns. A target can repeat the saving throw at "
"the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a "
"success. Emptying a vial of holy water on the target also ends the effect on "
"it.    \n"
"**Stunning Screech (1/Day).** The vrock emits a horrific screech. Each "
"creature within 20 feet of it that can hear it and that isn't a demon must "
"succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of "
"the vrock's next turn.\n"
