"**Telepathic Bond.** The fiend ignores the range restriction on its "

"its flying speed. Other than its size and speed, its statistics are the same "

"### Actions \n"
"**Claw (Fiend Form Only).** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., "
"one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.    \n"
"**Charm.** One humanoid the fiend can see within 30 feet of it must succeed "
"on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 day. The "
"charmed target obeys the fiend's verbal or telepathic commands. If the "
"target suffers any harm or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the "
"saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If the target successfully "
"saves against the effect, or if the effect on it ends, the target is immune "
"to this fiend's Charm for the next 24 hours.    \n"
"The fiend can have only one target charmed at a time. If it charms another, "
"the effect on the previous target ends.    \n"
"**Draining Kiss.** The fiend kisses a creature charmed by it or a willing "
"creature. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against "
"this magic, taking 32 (5d10 + 5) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as "
"much damage on a successful one. The target's hit point maximum is reduced "
"by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the "
"target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit "
"point maximum to 0.    \n"
"**Etherealness.** The fiend magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the "
"Material Plane, or vice versa.\n"
