"**Petrifying Gaze.** If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the "
"basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the basilisk can force the "
"creature to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk isn't "
"incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to "
"stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its "
"next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is "
"petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.    \n"
"A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw "
"at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the basilisk until the "
"start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again.    \n"
"If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the "
"save. If the basilisk sees its reflection within 30 feet of it in bright "
"light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its gaze. \n"
