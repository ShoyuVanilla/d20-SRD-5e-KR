"### Actions \n"
"**Multiattack.** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes "
"three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.    \n"
"**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one "
"target. _Hit:_ 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage.    \n"
"**Claw.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.    \n"
"**Tail.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one "
"target. _Hit:_ 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.    \n"
"**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within "
"120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving "
"throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving "
"throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a "
"success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for "
"it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next "
"24 hours.    \n"
"**Breath Weapons (Recharge 5â€“6).** The dragon uses one of the following "
"breath weapons.    \n"
"**Acid Breath.** The dragon exhales acid in an 60-foot line that is 5 feet "
"wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, "
"taking 54 (12d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a "
"successful one.    \n"
"**Slowing Breath.** The dragon exhales gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature "
"in that area must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed "
"save, the creature can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't "
"make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the creature can use "
"either an action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects "
"last for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of "
"each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful save. \n"

"### Legendary Actions \n"
"The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options "
"below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at "
"the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary "
"actions at the start of its turn.    \n"
"**Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.    \n"
"**Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.    \n"
"**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature "
"within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw "
"or take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can "
"then fly up to half its flying speed.\n"
