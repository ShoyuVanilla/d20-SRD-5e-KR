"**Shapechanger.** The weretiger can use its action to polymorph into a "
"tiger-humanoid hybrid or into a tiger, or back into its true form, which is "
"humanoid. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each "
"form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts "
"to its true form if it dies.    \n"

"feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the "
"same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be "
"knocked prone. If the target is prone, the weretiger can make one bite "
"attack against it as a bonus action. \n"
