"### Description Nobles wield great authority and influence as members of the "
"upper class, possessing wealth and connections that can make them as "
"powerful as monarchs and generals. A noble often travels in the company of "
"guards, as well as servants who are commoners. The noble's statistics can "
"also be used to represent courtiers who aren't of noble birth."
