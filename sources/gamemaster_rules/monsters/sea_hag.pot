"**Amphibious.** The hag can breathe air and water.    \n"
"**Horrific Appearance.** Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of "
"the hag and can see the hag's true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving "
"throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature "
"can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with "
"disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself "
"on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends "
"for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the next "
"24 hours.    \n"
"Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's true form is "
"sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving "
"throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has "
"disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag. \n"

"### Actions    \n"
"**Claws.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.    \n"
"**Death Glare.** The hag targets one frightened creature she can see within "
"30 feet of her. If the target can see the hag, it must succeed on a DC 11 "
"Wisdom saving throw against this magic or drop to 0 hit points.    \n"
"**Illusory Appearance.** The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing "
"or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like an ugly "
"creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag "
"takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.    \n"
"The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical "
"inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone "
"touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an "
"action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence "
"(Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.\n"
