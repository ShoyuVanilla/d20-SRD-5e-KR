"### Description It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a "
"silver tongue to keep a gang of bandits in line. The bandit captain has "
"these qualities in spades. In addition to managing a crew of selfish "
"malcontents, the pirate captain is a variation of the bandit captain, with a "
"ship to protect and command. To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete "
"out rewards and punishment on a regular basis. More than treasure, a bandit "
"captain or pirate captain craves infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the "
"captain's vanity or ego is more likely to be treated fairly than a prisoner "
"who does not or claims not to know anything of the captain's colorful "
"reputation."
