"### Actions \n"
"**Multiattack.** The dretch makes two attacks: one with its bite and one "
"with its claws.    \n"
"**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"3 (1d6) piercing damage.    \n"
"**Claws.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"5 (2d4) slashing damage.    \n"
"**Fetid Cloud (1/Day).** A 10­‐foot radius of disgusting green gas extends "
"out from the dretch. The gas spreads around corners, and its area is lightly "
"obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. Any "
"creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a DC 11 "
"Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next "
"turn. While poisoned in this way, the target can take either an action or a "
"bonus action on its turn, not both, and can't take reactions.\n"
