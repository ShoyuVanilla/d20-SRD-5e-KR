"### Actions \n"
"**Multiattack.** The devil makes two attacks with its chains.    \n"
"**Chain.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one "
"target. _Hit:_ 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape "
"DC 14) if the devil isn't already grappling a creature. Until this grapple "
"ends, the target is restrained and takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage at the "
"start of each of its turns.    \n"
"**Animate Chains (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** Up to four chains "
"the devil can see within 60 feet of it magically sprout razor-Â­edged barbs "
"and animate under the devil's control, provided that the chains aren't being "
"worn or carried.    \n"
"Each animated chain is an object with AC 20, 20 hit points, resistance to "
"piercing damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage. When the devil "
"uses multiattack on its turn, it can use each animated chain to make one "
"additional chain attack. An animated chain can grapple one creature of its "
"own but can't make attacks while grappling. An animated chain reverts to its "
"inanimate state if reduced to 0 hit points or if the devil is incapacitated "
"or dies. \n"

"### Reactions **Unnerving Mask.** When a creature the devil can see starts "
"its turn within 30 feet of the devil, the devil can create the illusion that "
"it looks like one of the creature's departed loved ones or bitter "
"enemies. If the creature can see the devil, it must succeed on a DC 14 "
"Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its turn."
