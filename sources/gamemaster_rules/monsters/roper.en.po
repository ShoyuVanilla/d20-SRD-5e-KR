"**False Appearance.** While the roper remains motionless, it is "
"indistinguishable from a normal cave formation, such as a stalagmite.    \n"
"**Grasping Tendrils.** The roper can have up to six tendrils at a time. Each "
"tendril can be attacked (AC 20; 10 hit points; immunity to poison and "
"psychic damage). Destroying a tendril deals no damage to the roper, which "
"can extrude a replacement tendril on its next turn. A tendril can also be "
"broken if a creature takes an action and succeeds on a DC 15 Strength check "
"against it.    \n"
"**Spider Climb.** The roper can climb difficult surfaces, including upside "
"down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. \n"

"### Actions \n"
"**Multiattack.** The roper makes four attacks with its tendrils, uses Reel, "
"and makes one attack with its bite.    \n"
"**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"22 (4d8 + 4) piercing damage.    \n"
"**Tendril.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 50 ft., one "
"creature. _Hit:_ The target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until the grapple "
"ends, the target is restrained and has disadvantage on Strength checks and "
"Strength saving throws, and the roper can't use the same tendril on another "
"target.    \n"
"**Reel.** The roper pulls each creature grappled by it up to 25 feet "
"straight toward it.\n"
