"### Actions    \n"
"**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one "
"target. _Hit:_ 40 (6d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) fire damage. If "
"the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple "
"ends, the target is restrained, and the remorhaz can't bite another target.    "
"\n"
"**Swallow.** The remorhaz makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller "
"creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, that creature takes the bite's "
"damage and is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature "
"is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other "
"effects outside the remorhaz, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start "
"of each of the remorhaz's turns.    \n"
"If the remorhaz takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature "
"inside it, the remorhaz must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at "
"the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall "
"prone in a space within 10 feet of the remorhaz. If the remorhaz dies, a "
"swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the "
"corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.\n"
