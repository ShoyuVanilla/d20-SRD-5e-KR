"**Aberrant Ground.** The ground in a 10-foot radius around the mouther is "
"doughlike difficult terrain. Each creature that starts its turn in that area "
"must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or have its speed reduced to 0 "
"until the start of its next turn.    \n"
"**Gibbering.** The mouther babbles incoherently while it can see any "
"creature and isn't incapacitated. Each creature that starts its turn within "
"20 feet of the mouther and can hear the gibbering must succeed on a DC 10 "
"Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature can't take reactions until "
"the start of its next turn and rolls a d8 to determine what it does during "
"its turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature "
"takes no action or bonus action and uses all its movement to move in a "
"randomly determined direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes a melee "
"attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach or does "
"nothing if it can't make such an attack. \n"

"### Actions \n"
"**Multiattack.** The gibbering mouther makes one bite attack and, if it can, "
"uses its Blinding Spittle.    \n"
"**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one "
"creature. _Hit:_ 17 (5d6) piercing damage. If the target is Medium or "
"smaller, it must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or be knocked "
"prone. If the target is killed by this damage, it is absorbed into the "
"mouther.    \n"
"**Blinding Spittle (Recharge 5–6).** The mouther spits a chemical glob at a "
"point it can see within 15 feet of it. The glob explodes in a blinding flash "
"of light on impact. Each creature within 5 feet of the flash must succeed on "
"a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of the mouther's "
"next turn.\n"
