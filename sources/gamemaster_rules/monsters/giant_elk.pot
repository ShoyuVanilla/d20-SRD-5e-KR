"### Description The majestic giant elk is rare to the point that its "
"appearance is often taken as a foreshadowing of an important event, such as "
"the birth of a king. Legends tell of gods that take the form of giant elk "
"when visiting the Material Plane. Many cultures therefore believe that to "
"hunt these creatures is to invite divine wrath."
