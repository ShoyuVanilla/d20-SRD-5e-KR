"### Actions \n"
"**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one "
"creature. _Hit:_ 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on "
"a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 24 hours. Until this "
"poison ends, the target is unconscious. Another creature can use an action "
"to shake the target awake.    \n"
"**Constrict.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one Medium or "
"smaller creature. _Hit:_ 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target is "
"grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, "
"and the couatl can't constrict another target.    \n"
"**Change Shape.** The couatl magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast "
"that has a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back into its "
"true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is "
"wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the couatl's "
"choice).    \n"
"In a new form, the couatl retains its game statistics and ability to speak, "
"but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and other actions are "
"replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and "
"capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) "
"that the new form has but that it lacks. If the new form has a bite attack, "
"the couatl can use its bite in that form.\n"
