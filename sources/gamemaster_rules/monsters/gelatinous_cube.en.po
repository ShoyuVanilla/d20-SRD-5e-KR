"**Ooze Cube.** The cube takes up its entire space. Other creatures can enter "
"the space, but a creature that does so is subjected to the cube's Engulf and "
"has disadvantage on the saving throw.    \n"
"Creatures inside the cube can be seen but have total cover.    \n"
"A creature within 5 feet of the cube can take an action to pull a creature "

"The cube can hold only one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller "
"creatures inside it at a time.    \n"
"**Transparent.** Even when the cube is in plain sight, it takes a successful "
"DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a cube that has neither moved nor "
"attacked. A creature that tries to enter the cube's space while unaware of "
"the cube is surprised by the cube. \n"

"### Actions \n"
"**Pseudopod.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one "
"creature. _Hit:_ 10 (3d6) acid damage.    \n"
"**Engulf.** The cube moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter "
"Large or smaller creatures' spaces. Whenever the cube enters a creature's "
"space, the creature must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw.    \n"
"On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to "
"the side of the cube. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the "
"consequences of a failed saving throw.    \n"
"On a failed save, the cube enters the creature's space, and the creature "
"takes 10 (3d6) acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't "
"breathe, is restrained, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each "
"of the cube's turns. When the cube moves, the engulfed creature moves with "
"it.    \n"
"An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 12 "
"Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its "
"choice within 5 feet of the cube.\n"
