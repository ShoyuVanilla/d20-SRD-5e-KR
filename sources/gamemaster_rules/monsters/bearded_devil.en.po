"### Actions \n"
"**Multiattack.** The devil makes two attacks: one with its beard and one "
"with its glaive.    \n"
"**Beard.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one "
"creature. _Hit:_ 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on "
"a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. While "
"poisoned in this way, the target can't regain hit points. The target can "
"repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect "
"on itself on a success.    \n"
"**Glaive.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one "
"target. _Hit:_ 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature "
"other than an undead or a construct, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution "
"saving throw or lose 5 (1d10) hit points at the start of each of its turns "
"due to an infernal wound. Each time the devil hits the wounded target with "
"this attack, the damage dealt by the wound increases by 5 (1d10). Any "
"creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a successful DC 12 "
"Wisdom (Medicine) check. The wound also closes if the target receives "
"magical healing.\n"
