"attacks.    \n"
"**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one "
"target. _Hit:_ 26 (3d12 + 7) piercing damage.    \n"
"**Claw.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one "
"target. _Hit:_ 16 (2d8 + 7) slashing damage.    \n"

"to 10 feet away from the dragon turtle and knocked prone.    \n"
"**Steam Breath (Recharge 5–6).** The dragon turtle exhales scalding steam in "

"damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant resistance "
"against this damage.\n"
