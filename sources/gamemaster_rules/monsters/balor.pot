"**Death Throes.** When the balor dies, it explodes, and each creature within "
"30 feet of it must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) "

"one. The explosion ignites flammable objects in that area that aren't being "
"worn or carried, and it destroys the balor's weapons.    \n"
"**Fire Aura.** At the start of each of the balor's turns, each creature "
"within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage, and flammable objects in the "
"aura that aren't being worn or carried ignite. A creature that touches the "
"balor or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 10 "
"(3d6) fire damage.    \n"
"**Magic Resistance.** The balor has advantage on saving throws against "
