"**Shapechanger.** The doppelganger can use its action to polymorph into a "
"Small or Medium humanoid it has seen, or back into its true form. Its "
"statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it "
"is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it "
"dies.    \n"
"**Ambusher.** The doppelganger has advantage on attack rolls against any "
"creature it has surprised. Surprise Attack. If the doppelganger surprises a "
"creature and hits it with an attack during the first round of combat, the "
"target takes an extra 10 (3d6) damage from the attack. \n"

"### Actions \n"
"**Multiattack.** The doppelganger makes two melee attacks.   \n"
"**Slam.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.    \n"
"**Read Thoughts.** The doppelganger magically reads the surface thoughts of "
"one creature within 60 feet of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 "
"feet of wood or dirt, 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of "
"lead blocks it. While the target is in range, the doppelganger can continue "
"reading its thoughts, as long as the doppelganger's concentration isn't "
"broken (as if concentrating on a spell). While reading the target's mind, "
"the doppelganger has advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception, "
"Intimidation, and Persuasion) checks against the target.\n"
