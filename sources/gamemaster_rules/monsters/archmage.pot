"### Description Archmages are powerful (and usually quite old) spellcasters "
"dedicated to the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel kings and "
"queens, while evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom. Those who are "
"neither good nor evil sequester themselves in remote towers to practice "
"their magic without interruption. An archmage typically has one or more "
"apprentice mages, and an archmage's abode has numerous magical wards and "
"guardians to discourage interlopers."
