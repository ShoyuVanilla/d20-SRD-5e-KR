"### Description Knights are warriors who pledge service to rulers, religious "
"orders, and noble causes. A knight's alignment determines the extent to "
"which a pledge is honored. Whether undertaking a quest or patrolling a "
"realm, a knight often travels with an entourage that includes squires and "
"hirelings who are commoners."
