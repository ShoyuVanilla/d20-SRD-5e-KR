"**Multiattack.** The aboleth makes three tentacle attacks.    \n"
"**Tentacle.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one "
"target. _Hit:_ 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, "
"it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become diseased. The "
"disease has no effect for 1 minute and can be removed by any magic that "
"cures disease. After 1 minute, the diseased creature's skin becomes "
"translucent and slimy, the creature can't regain hit points unless it is "
"underwater, and the disease can be removed only by heal or another "
"disease-­‐curing spell of 6th level or higher. When the creature is outside "
"a body of water, it takes 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10 minutes unless "
"moisture is applied to the skin before 10 minutes have passed.    \n"
"**Tail.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft. one target. _Hit:_ "
"15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.    \n"
"**Enslave (3/Day).** The aboleth targets one creature it can see within 30 "
"feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be "
"magically charmed by the aboleth until the aboleth dies or until it is on a "
"different plane of existence from the target. The charmed target is under "
"the aboleth's control and can't take reactions, and the aboleth and the "
"target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance.    "
"\n"
"Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving "
"throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the "
"target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from "
"the aboleth.    \n"

"actions at the start of its turn.    \n"
"**Detect.** The aboleth makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.    \n"
"**Tail Swipe.** The aboleth makes one tail attack.    \n"
