"### Actions \n"
"**Crush.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one "
"creature. _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the darkmantle attaches "
"to the target. If the target is Medium or smaller and the darkmantle has "
"advantage on the attack roll, it attaches by engulfing the target's head, "
"and the target is also blinded and unable to breathe while the darkmantle is "
"attached in this way.    \n"
"While attached to the target, the darkmantle can attack no other creature "
"except the target but has advantage on its attack rolls. The darkmantle's "
"speed also becomes 0, it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed, and it "
"moves with the target.    \n"
"A creature can detach the darkmantle by making a successful DC 13 Strength "
"check as an action. On its turn, the darkmantle can detach itself from the "
"target by using 5 feet of movement.    \n"
"**Darkness Aura (1/Day).** A 15-­‐foot radius of magical darkness extends "
"out from the darkmantle, moves with it, and spreads around corners. The "
"darkness lasts as long as the darkmantle maintains concentration, up to 10 "
"minutes (as if concentrating on a spell). Darkvision can't penetrate this "
"darkness, and no natural light can illuminate it. If any of the darkness "
"overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the "
"spell creating the light is dispelled.\n"
