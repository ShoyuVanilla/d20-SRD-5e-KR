"**Bound.** The shield guardian is magically bound to an amulet. As long as "
"the guardian and its amulet are on the same plane of existence, the amulet's "
"wearer can telepathically call the guardian to travel to it, and the "
"guardian knows the distance and direction to the amulet. If the guardian is "
"within 60 feet of the amulet's wearer, half of any damage the wearer takes "
"(rounded up) is transferred to the guardian.    \n"
"**Regeneration.** The shield guardian regains 10 hit points at the start of "
"its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.    \n"
"**Spell Storing.** A spellcaster who wears the shield guardian's amulet can "
"cause the guardian to store one spell of 4th level or lower. To do so, the "
"wearer must cast the spell on the guardian. The spell has no effect but is "
"stored within the guardian. When commanded to do so by the wearer or when a "
"situation arises that was predefined by the spellcaster, the guardian casts "
"the stored spell with any parameters set by the original caster, requiring "
"no components. When the spell is cast or a new spell is stored, any "
"previously stored spell is lost. \n"
