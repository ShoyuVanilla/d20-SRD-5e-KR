"**Innate Spellcasting.** The dryad's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma "
"(spell save DC 14). The dryad can innately cast the following spells, "
"requiring no material components:    \n"
"At will: **_druidcraft_**    \n"
"3/day each: **_entangle_**, **_goodberry_**    \n"

"**Magic Resistance.** The dryad has advantage on saving throws against "
"spells and other magical effects.    \n"
"**Speak with Beasts and Plants.** The dryad can communicate with beasts and "
"plants as if they shared a language.    \n"
"**Tree Stride.** Once on her turn, the dryad can use 10 feet of her movement "
"to step magically into one living tree within her reach and emerge from a "

"### Actions \n"
"**Club.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +2 to hit (+6 to hit with shillelagh), "
"reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage, or 8 (1d8 + 4) "
"bludgeoning damage with shillelagh.    \n"
"**Fey Charm.** The dryad targets one humanoid or beast that she can see "
"within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the dryad, it must succeed on a "
"DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed. The charmed creature "
"regards the dryad as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although "
"the target isn't under the dryad's control, it takes the dryad's requests or "
"actions in the most favorable way it can.    \n"
"Each time the dryad or its allies do anything harmful to the target, it can "
"repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a "
"success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the dryad dies, is on "
"a different plane of existence from the target, or ends the effect as a "
"bonus action. If a target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune "
"to the dryad's Fey Charm for the next 24 hours.    \n"
"The dryad can have no more than one humanoid and up to three beasts charmed "
"at a time.\n"
