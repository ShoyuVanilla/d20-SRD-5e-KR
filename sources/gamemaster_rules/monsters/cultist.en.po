"### Description Cultists swear allegiance to dark powers such as elemental "
"princes, demon lords, or archdevils. Most conceal their loyalties to avoid "
"being ostracized, imprisoned, or executed for their beliefs. Unlike evil "
"acolytes, cultists often show signs of insanity in their beliefs and "
"practices."
