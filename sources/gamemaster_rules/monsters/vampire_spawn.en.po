"**Regeneration.** The vampire regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn "
"if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If "
"the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait "
"doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.    \n"
"**Spider Climb.** The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside "
"down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.    \n"
"**Vampire Weaknesses.** The vampire has the following flaws:    \n"
"_Forbiddance._ The vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation "
"from one of the occupants.    \n"
"_Harmed by Running Water._ The vampire takes 20 acid damage when it ends its "
"turn in running water.    \n"
"_Stake to the Heart._ The vampire is destroyed if a piercing weapon made of "
"wood is driven into its heart while it is incapacitated in its resting "
"place.    \n"
"_Sunlight Hypersensitivity._ The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it "
"starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on "
"attack rolls and ability checks. \n"

"### Actions \n"
"**Multiattack.** The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a "
"bite attack.    \n"
"**Claws.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one "
"creature. _Hit:_ 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the "
"vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 13).    \n"
"**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing "
"creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or "
"restrained. _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic "
"damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the "
"necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that "
"amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The "
"target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.\n"
