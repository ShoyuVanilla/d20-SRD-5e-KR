"### Actions \n"
"**Multiattack.** The cloaker makes two attacks: one with its bite and one "
"with its tail.    \n"
"**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one "
"creature. _Hit:_ 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, and if the target is Large or "
"smaller, the cloaker attaches to it. If the cloaker has advantage against "
"the target, the cloaker attaches to the target's head, and the target is "
"blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, "
"the cloaker can make this attack only against the target and has advantage "
"on the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its "
"movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach "
"the cloaker by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check.    \n"
"**Tail.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one "
"creature. _Hit:_ 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.    \n"
"**Moan.** Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear its moan "
"and that isn't an aberration must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or "
"become frightened until the end of the cloaker's next turn. If a creature's "
"saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cloaker's moan for "
"the next 24 hours.    \n"
"**Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The cloaker magically "
"creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn't in bright light. The "
"duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to "
"make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is "
"ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.    \n"
"Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell "
"while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether "
"it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by "
"this magical effect if it can't see or if it relies on senses other than "
"sight.    \n"
"A duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack "
"hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect "
"that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.\n"
