"### Actions \n"
"**Multiattack.** The devil makes three attacks: one with its bite, one with "
"its claws, and one with its tail.    \n"
"**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage.    \n"
"**Claws.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one "
"target. _Hit:_ 10 (2d4 + 5) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage.    \n"
"**Tail.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one "
"target. _Hit:_ 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage.    "
"\n"
"**Wall of Ice (Recharge 6).** The devil magically forms an opaque wall of "
"ice on a solid surface it can see within 60 feet of it. The wall is 1 foot "
"thick and up to 30 feet long and 10 feet high, or it's a hemispherical dome "
"up to 20 feet in diameter.    \n"
"When the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed out of it by the "
"shortest route. The creature chooses which side of the wall to end up on, "
"unless the creature is incapacitated. The creature then makes a DC 17 "
"Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) cold damage on a failed save, or "
"half as much damage on a successful one.    \n"
"The wall lasts for 1 minute or until the devil is incapacitated or dies. The "
"wall can be damaged and breached; each 10-Â­foot section has AC 5, 30 hit "
"points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, "
"poison, and psychic damage. If a section is destroyed, it leaves behind a "
"sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. Whenever a creature "
"finishes moving through the frigid air on a turn, willingly or otherwise, "
"the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) "
"cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful "
"one. The frigid air dissipates when the rest of the wall vanishes.\n"
