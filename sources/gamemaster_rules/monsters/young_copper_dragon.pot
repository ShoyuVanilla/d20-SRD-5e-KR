"### Actions \n"
"**Multiattack.** The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two "
"with its claws.    \n"
"**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage.    \n"
"**Claw.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.    \n"
"**Breath Weapons (Recharge 5â€“6).** The dragon uses one of the following "
"breath weapons.    \n"
"**Acid Breath.** The dragon exhales acid in an 40-foot line that is 5 feet "
"wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, "
"taking 40 (9d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a "
"successful one.    \n"
"**Slowing Breath.** The dragon exhales gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature "
"in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed "
"save, the creature can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't "
"make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the creature can use "
"either an action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects "
"last for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of "
"each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful save.\n"
