"### Actions \n"
"**Blood Drain.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one "
"creature. _Hit:_ 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, and the stirge attaches to the "
"target. While attached, the stirge doesn't attack. Instead, at the start of "
"each of the stirge's turns, the target loses 5 (1d4 + 3) hit points due to "
"blood loss.    \n"
"The stirge can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. It does so "
"after it drains 10 hit points of blood from the target or the target dies. A "
"creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the stirge.\n"
