"### Actions \n"
"**Multiattack.** The golem makes two slam attacks.    \n"
"**Slam.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.    \n"
"**Slow (Recharge 5–6).** The golem targets one or more creatures it can see "
"within 10 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw "
"against this magic. On a failed save, a target can't use reactions, its "
"speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn. In "
"addition, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its "
"turn, not both. These effects last for 1 minute. A target can repeat the "
"saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on "
"a success.\n"
