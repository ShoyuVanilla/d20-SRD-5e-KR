"### Description A worg is an evil predator that delights in hunting and "
"devouring creatures weaker than itself. Cunning and malevolent, worgs roam "
"across the remote wilderness or are raised by goblins and hobgoblins. Those "
"creatures use worgs as mounts, but a worg will turn on its rider if it feels "
"mistreated or malnourished. Worgs speak in their own language and Goblin, "
"and a few learn to speak Common as well."
