"### Description Priests bring the teachings of their gods to the common "
"folk. They are the spiritual leaders of temples and shrines and often hold "
"positions of influence in their communities. Evil priests might work openly "
"under a tyrant, or they might be the leaders of religious sects hidden in "
"the shadows of good society, overseeing depraved rites. A priest typically "
"has one or more acolytes to help with religious ceremonies and other sacred "
"duties."
