"### Actions \n"
"**Multiattack.** The djinni makes three scimitar attacks.    \n"
"**Scimitar.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one "
"target. _Hit:_ 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) lightning or "
"thunder damage (djinni's choice).    \n"
"**Create Whirlwind.** A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air "
"magically forms on a point the djinni can see within 120 feet of it. The "
"whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains concentration (as if "
"concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the "
"whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be restrained by "
"it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and "
"creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if "
"the djinni loses sight of it.    \n"
"A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the "
"whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check. If the "
"check succeeds, the creature is no longer restrained and moves to the "
"nearest space outside the whirlwind.\n"
