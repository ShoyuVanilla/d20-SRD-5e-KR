"### Actions \n"
"**Life Drain.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one "
"creature. _Hit:_ 21 (4d8 + 3) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a "
"DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an "
"amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target "
"finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point "
"maximum to 0.    \n"
"**Create Specter.** The wraith targets a humanoid within 10 feet of it that "
"has been dead for no longer than 1 minute and died violently. The target's "
"spirit rises as a specter in the space of its corpse or in the nearest "
"unoccupied space. The specter is under the wraith's control. The wraith can "
"have no more than seven specters under its control at one time.\n"
