"**Amphibious.** The hag can breathe air and water.    \n"
"**Innate Spellcasting.** The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma "
"(spell save DC 12). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no "
"material components:    \n"
"At will: **_dancing lights_**, **_minor illusion_**, **_vicious mockery_**    "
"\n"
"**Mimicry.** The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature "
"that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 "
"Wisdom (Insight) check. \n"

"### Actions    \n"
"**Claws.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ "
"13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.    \n"
"**Illusory Appearance.** The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing "
"or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another "
"creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the "
"hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.    \n"
"The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical "
"inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but "
"someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must "
"take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 "
"Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.    "
"\n"
"**Invisible Passage.** The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks "
"or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a "
"spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so "
"she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is "
"invisible with her.\n"
