"# Legendary Creatures \n"
"A legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures can't. It can "
"take special actions outside its turn, and it might exert magical influence "
"for miles around.    \n"
"If a creature assumes the form of a legendary creature, such as through a "
"spell, it doesn't gain that form's legendary actions, lair actions, or "
"regional effects. \n"

"## Legendary Actions A legendary creature can take a certain number of "
"special actions--called legendary actions--outside its turn. Only one "
"legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another "
"creature's turn. A creature regains its spent legendary actions at the start "
"of its turn. It can forgo using them, and it can't use them while "
"incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can't "
"use them until after its first turn in the combat."

"## A Legendary Creature's Lair A legendary creature might have a section "
"describing its lair and the special effects it can create while there, "
"either by act of will or simply by being present. Such a section applies "
"only to a legendary creature that spends a great deal of time in its lair.  "
"### Lair Actions If a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them "
"to harness the ambient magic in its lair. On initiative count 20 (losing all "
"initiative ties), it can use one of its lair action options. It can't do so "
"while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it "
"can't use one until after its first turn in the combat."
