"# Diseases \n"
"A plague ravages the kingdom, setting the adventurers on a quest to find a "
"cure. An adventurer emerges from an ancient tomb, unopened for centuries, "
"and soon finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A warlock offends "
"some dark power and contracts a strange affliction that spreads whenever he "
"casts spells.    \n"
"A simple outbreak might amount to little more than a small drain on party "
"resources, curable by a casting of **_lesser restoration_**. A more "
"complicated outbreak can form the basis of one or more adventures as "
"characters search for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and deal with "
"the consequences.    \n"
"A disease that does more than infect a few party members is primarily a plot "
"device. The rules help describe the effects of the disease and how it can be "
"cured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren't bound by a common set "
"of rules. Diseases can affect any creature, and a given illness might or "
"might not pass from one race or kind of creature to another. A plague might "
"affect only constructs or undead, or sweep through a halfling neighborhood "
"but leave other races untouched. What matters is the story you want to "
"tell. \n"

"### Cackle Fever \n"
"This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While "
"in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad "
"laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: \"the "
"shrieks.\"    \n"
"Symptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include fever and "
"disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that "
"can't be removed until the disease is cured.    \n"
"Any event that causes the infected creature great stress--including entering "
"combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare--forces the "
"creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the "
"creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with mad "
"laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end "
"of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated "
"condition on a success.    \n"
"Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected "
"creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution "
"saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature "
"succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular "
"infected creature for 24 hours.    \n"
"At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 "
"Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and "
"for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the "
"saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A "
"creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined "
"form of indefinite madness, as described later in this chapter. \n"

"### Sewer Plague \n"
"Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that "
"incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are "
"sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats "
"and otyughs.    \n"
"When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, "
"or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the "
"disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or "
"become infected.    \n"
"It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague's symptoms to manifest in an infected "
"creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers "
"one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of hit "
"points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.    "
"\n"
"At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 "
"Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level "
"of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character's exhaustion level "
"decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected "
"creature's level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the "
"disease. \n"

"### Sight Rot \n"
"This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds "
"the victim.    \n"
"A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a "
"DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, "
"the creature's vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a −1 "
"penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of "
"each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it "
"reaches −5, the victim is blinded until its sight is restored by magic such "
"as **_lesser restoration_** or **_heal_**.    \n"
"Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in "
"some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an "
"herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the "
"eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening "
"after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease "
"entirely.\n"
