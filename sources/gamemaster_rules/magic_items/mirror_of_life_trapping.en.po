"When this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint "
"images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit "
"points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is "
"destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.    \n"
"If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of "
"it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It "
"remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again.    "
"\n"
"Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror "
"while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or "
"be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the "
"mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with "
"advantage if the creature knows the mirror's nature, and constructs succeed "
"on the saving throw automatically.    \n"
"An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that "
"reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't "
"age, and they don't need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within "
"a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the "
"creature is confined to the cell until freed.    \n"
"If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are "
"already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to "
"accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied "
"space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is "
"shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied "
"spaces near it.    \n"
"While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name "
"of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The "
"creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the "
"mirror's surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.    \n"
"In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and "
"free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along "
"with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and "
"facing away from it.\n"
