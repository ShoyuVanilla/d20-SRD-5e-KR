"While wearing this ring, you can speak its command word as an action to "
"summon a particular djinni from the Elemental Plane of Air. The djinni "
"appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 120 feet of you. It remains "
"as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of "
"1 hour, or until it drops to 0 hit points. It then returns to its home "
"plane.    \n"
"While summoned, the djinni is friendly to you and your companions. It obeys "
"any commands you give it, no matter what language you use. If you fail to "
"command it, the djinni defends itself against attackers but takes no other "
"actions.    \n"
"After the djinni departs, it can't be summoned again for 24 hours, and the "
"ring becomes nonmagical if the djinni dies. \n"
