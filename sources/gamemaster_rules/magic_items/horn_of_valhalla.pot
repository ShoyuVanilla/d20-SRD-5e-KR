"You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from "
"the Valhalla appear within 60 feet of you. They use the statistics of a "
"berserker. They return to Valhalla after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit "
"points. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have "
"passed.    \n"
"Four types of **horn of Valhalla** are known to exist, each made of a "
"different metal. The horn's type determines how many berserkers answer its "
"summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the horn's "
"type or determines it randomly. \n"
