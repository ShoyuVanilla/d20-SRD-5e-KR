"This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +3 bonus to "
"attack and damage rolls made with it.    \n"
"The staff has 10 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using it, you can "
"expend up to 3 of its charges. For each charge you expend, the target takes "
"an extra 1d6 force damage. The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily "
"at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff "
"becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff. \n"
