"This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a "
"handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.    \n"
"You can use an action to unfold and place the **well of many worlds** on a "
"solid surface, whereupon it creates a two-way portal to another world or "
"plane of existence. Each time the item opens a portal, the GM decides where "
"it leads. You can use an action to close an open portal by taking hold of "
"the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Once **well of many worlds** has "
"opened a portal, it can't do so again for 1d8 hours. \n"
