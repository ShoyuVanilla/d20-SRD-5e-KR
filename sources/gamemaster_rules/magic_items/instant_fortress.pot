"You can use an action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and "
"speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains "
"until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which "
"works only if the fortress is empty.    \n"
"The fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with "
"arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided "
"into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The "
"ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has "
"a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, "
"which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the **_knock_** spell "
"and similar magic, such as that of a **chime of opening**.    \n"
"Each creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 "
"Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or "
"half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is "
"pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in "
"the area that aren't being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed "
"automatically.    \n"
"The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped "
"over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity "
"to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to "
"all other damage. Only a **_wish_** spell can repair the fortress (this use "
"of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each "
"casting of **_wish_** causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 "
"hit points. \n"
