"This hollow metal tube measures about 1 foot long and weighs 1 pound. You "
"can strike it as an action, pointing it at an object within 120 feet of you "
"that can be opened, such as a door, lid, or lock. The chime issues a clear "
"tone, and one lock or latch on the object opens unless the sound can't reach "
"the object. If no locks or latches remain, the object itself opens.    \n"
"The chime can be used ten times. After the tenth time, it cracks and becomes "
"useless. \n"
