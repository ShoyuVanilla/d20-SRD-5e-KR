"This wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 1 "
"expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a "
"d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.    \n"
"**Command.** While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 "
"charge and command another creature to flee or grovel, as with the "
"**_command_** spell (save DC 15).    \n"
"**Cone of Fear.** While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 2 "
"charges, causing the wand's tip to emit a 60-foot cone of amber light. Each "
"creature in the cone must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become "
"frightened of you for 1 minute. While it is frightened in this way, a "
"creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, "
"and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't "
"take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to "
"escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can "
"move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its "
"turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself "
"on a success. \n"
