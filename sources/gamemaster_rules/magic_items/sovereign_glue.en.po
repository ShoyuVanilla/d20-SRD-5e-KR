"This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond "
"between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been "
"coated inside with **oil of slipperiness**. When found, a container contains "
"1d6 + 1 ounces.    \n"
"One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 "
"minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only "
"by the application of **universal solvent** or **oil of etherealness**, or "
"with a **_wish_** spell. \n"
