"When you attack an object with this magic sword and hit, maximize your "
"weapon damage dice against the target.    \n"
"When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack "
"roll, that target takes an extra 4d6 slashing damage. Then roll another "
"d20. If you roll a 20, you lop off one of the target's limbs, with the "
"effect of such loss determined by the GM. If the creature has no limb to "
"sever, you lop off a portion of its body instead.    \n"
"In addition, you can speak the sword's command word to cause the blade to "
"shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 "
"feet. Speaking the command word again or sheathing the sword puts out the "
"light. \n"
