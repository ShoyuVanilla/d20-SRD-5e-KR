"Beads of this cloudy gray oil form on the outside of its container and "
"quickly evaporate. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along "
"with the equipment it's wearing and carrying (one additional vial is "
"required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 "
"minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the "
"**_etherealness_** spell for 1 hour."
