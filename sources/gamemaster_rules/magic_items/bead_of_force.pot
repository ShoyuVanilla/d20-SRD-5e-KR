"This small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in diameter and weighs an "
"ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4 **beads of force** are found together.    \n"
"You can use an action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes on "
"impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the "
"bead landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 force "
"damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 "
"minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area "
"is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save, or are "
"partially within the area, are pushed away from the center of the sphere "
"until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the "
"sphere's wall. No attack or other effect can.    \n"
"An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's wall, "
"moving the sphere up to half the creature's walking speed. The sphere can be "
"picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the "
"weight of creatures inside. \n"
