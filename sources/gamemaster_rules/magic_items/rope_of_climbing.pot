"This 60-foot length of silk rope weighs 3 pounds and can hold up to 3,000 "
"pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak the "
"command word, the rope animates. As a bonus action, you can command the "
"other end to move toward a destination you choose. That end moves 10 feet on "
"your turn when you first command it and 10 feet on each of your turns until "
"reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or until you tell "
"it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an "
"object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself "
"for carrying.    \n"
"If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1- foot intervals along "
"the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants "
"advantage on checks made to climb it.    \n"
"The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes "
"as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, "
"it is destroyed.\n"
