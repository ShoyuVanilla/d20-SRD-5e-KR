"This robe has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at "
"dawn. While you wear it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cause "
"the garment to display a shifting pattern of dazzling hues until the end of "
"your next turn. During this time, the robe sheds bright light in a 30-foot "
"radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Creatures that can see you "
"have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. In addition, any creature in "
"the bright light that can see you when the robe's power is activated must "
"succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become stunned until the effect "
"ends."
