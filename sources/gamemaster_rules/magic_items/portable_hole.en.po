"This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a "
"handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.    \n"
"You can use an action to unfold a **portable hole** and place it on or "
"against a solid surface, whereupon the **portable hole** creates an "
"extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole "
"exists on a different plane, so it can't be used to create open "
"passages. Any creature inside an open **portable hole** can exit the hole by "
"climbing out of it.    \n"
"You can use an action to close a **portable hole** by taking hold of the "
"edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and "
"any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No "
"matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.    \n"
"If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional "
"space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful "
"check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the "
"**portable hole** or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a "
"closed **portable hole** can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time "
"it begins to suffocate.    \n"
"Placing a **portable hole** inside an extradimensional space created by a "
"**bag of holding**, **handy haversack**, or similar item instantly destroys "
"both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where "
"the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the "
"gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral "
"Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be "
"reopened. \n"
