"This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You "
"can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge "
"or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As the sphere moves "
"through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.    \n"
"Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity "
"modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is restrained "
"until you take a bonus action to speak the command word again to release "
"it. Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands to contract and "
"become a sphere once more.    \n"
"A creature, including the one restrained, can use an action to make a DC 20 "
"Strength check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed, "
"and the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails, any further "
"attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have "
"elapsed.    \n"
"Once the bands are used, they can't be used again until the next dawn. \n"
