"While holding this rod, you can use an action to activate it. The rod then "
"instantly transports you and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see "
"to a paradise that exists in an extraplanar space. You choose the form that "
"the paradise takes. It could be a tranquil garden, lovely glade, cheery "
"tavern, immense palace, tropical island, fantastic carnival, or whatever "
"else you can imagine. Regardless of its nature, the paradise contains enough "
"water and food to sustain its visitors. Everything else that can be "
"interacted with inside the extraplanar space can exist only there. For "
"example, a flower picked from a garden in the paradise disappears if it is "
"taken outside the extraplanar space.    \n"
"For each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains hit points as if it "
"had spent 1 Hit Die. Also, creatures don't age while in the paradise, "
"although time passes normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for up to "
"200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down).    \n"
"When the time runs out or you use an action to end it, all visitors reappear "
"in the location they occupied when you activated the rod, or an unoccupied "
"space nearest that location. The rod can't be used again until ten days have "
"passed. \n"
