"An **Ioun stone** is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy "
"revered on some worlds. Many types of **Ioun stone** exist, each type a "
"distinct combination of shape and color.    \n"
"When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone "
"orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to "
"you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the "
"stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll "
"against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can "
"use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.    \n"
"A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is "
"considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.    "
"\n"
"**Absorption (Very Rare).** While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your "
"head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast "
"by a creature you can see and targeting only you.    \n"
"Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull "
"gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher "
"than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't cancel "
"it.    \n"
"**Agility (Very Rare).** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum "
"of 20, while this deep red sphere orbits your head.    \n"
"**Awareness (Rare).** You can't be surprised while this dark blue rhomboid "
"orbits your head. Fortitude (Very Rare). Your Constitution score increases "
"by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink rhomboid orbits your head.    \n"
"**Greater Absorption (Legendary).** While this marbled lavender and green "
"ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of "
"8th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.    "
"\n"
"Once the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull "
"gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher "
"than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't cancel "
"it.    \n"
"**Insight (Very Rare).** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of "
"20, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your head.    \n"
"**Intellect (Very Rare).** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a "
"maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head.    "
"\n"
"**Leadership (Very Rare).** Your Charisma score increases by 2, to a maximum "
"of 20, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits your head.    \n"
"**Mastery (Legendary).** Your proficiency bonus increases by 1 while this "
"pale green prism orbits your head.    \n"
"**Protection (Rare).** You gain a +1 bonus to AC while this dusty rose prism "
"orbits your head.    \n"
"**Regeneration (Legendary).** You regain 15 hit points at the end of each "
"hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that you have at "
"least 1 hit point.    \n"
"**Reserve (Rare).** This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, "
"holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 levels worth of "
"spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 âˆ’ 1 levels of stored spells "
"chosen by the GM.    \n"
"Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by "
"touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be "
"stored in the stone. If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is "
"expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell "
"determines how much space it uses.    \n"
"While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The "
"spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and "
"spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if "
"you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, "
"freeing up space.    \n"
"**Strength (Very Rare).** Your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum "
"of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.    \n"
"**Sustenance (Rare).** You don't need to eat or drink while this clear "
"spindle orbits your head. \n"
