"This staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at "
"dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, a swarm of insects "
"consumes and destroys the staff, then disperses.    \n"
"**Spells.** While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of "
"its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell "
"save DC: **_giant insect_** (4 charges) or **_insect plague_** (5 charges).    "
"\n"
"**Insect Cloud.** While holding the staff, you can use an action and expend "
"1 charge to cause a swarm of harmless flying insects to spread out in a "
"30-foot radius from you. The insects remain for 10 minutes, making the area "
"heavily obscured for creatures other than you. The swarm moves with you, "
"remaining centered on you. A wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses "
"the swarm and ends the effect. \n"
