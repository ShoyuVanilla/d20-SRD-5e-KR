"You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. While you "
"are attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats are indifferent "
"toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.    \n"
"The pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as an action, you can use a "
"bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats with "
"each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile of "
"you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the GM). If there aren't "
"enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward "
"the music by the shortest available route but aren't under your control "
"otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.    \n"
"Whenever a swarm of rats that isn't under another creature's control comes "
"within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make a "
"Charisma check contested by the swarm's Wisdom check. If you lose the "
"contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the "
"pipes' music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is "
"swayed by the pipes' music and becomes friendly to you and your companions "
"for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A "
"friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly "
"swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly swarm "
"starts its turn and can't hear the pipes' music, your control over that "
"swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed "
"by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.\n"
