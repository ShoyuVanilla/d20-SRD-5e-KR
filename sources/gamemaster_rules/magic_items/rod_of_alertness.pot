"This rod has a flanged head and the following properties.    \n"
"**Alertness.** While holding the rod, you have advantage on Wisdom "
"(Perception) checks and on rolls for initiative.    \n"
"**Spells.** While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast one of the "
"following spells from it: **_detect evil and good_**, **_detect magic_**, "
"**_detect poison and disease_**, or **_see invisibility_**.    \n"
"**Protective Aura.** As an action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in "
"the ground, whereupon the rod's head sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius "
"and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While in that bright light, you and "
"any creature that is friendly to you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws "
"and can sense the location of any invisible hostile creature that is also in "
"the bright light.    \n"
"The rod's head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes, or when a "
"creature uses an action to pull the rod from the ground. This property can't "
"be used again until the next dawn.\n"
