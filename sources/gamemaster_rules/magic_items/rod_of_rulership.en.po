"You can use an action to present the rod and command obedience from each "
"creature of your choice that you can see within 120 feet of you. Each target "
"must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 8 "
"hours. While charmed in this way, the creature regards you as its trusted "
"leader. If harmed by you or your companions, or commanded to do something "
"contrary to its nature, a target ceases to be charmed in this way. The rod "
"can't be used again until the next dawn."
