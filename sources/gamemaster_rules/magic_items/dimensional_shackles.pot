"You can use an action to place these shackles on an incapacitated "
"creature. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size. In "
"addition to serving as mundane manacles, the shackles prevent a creature "
"bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including "
"teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. They don't "
"prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.    \n"
"You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can use an "
"action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC "
"30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature breaks free and "
"destroys the shackles. \n"
