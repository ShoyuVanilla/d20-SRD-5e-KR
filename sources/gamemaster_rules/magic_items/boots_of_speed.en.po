"While you wear these boots, you can use a bonus action and click the boots' "
"heels together. If you do, the boots double your walking speed, and any "
"creature that makes an opportunity attack against you has disadvantage on "
"the attack roll. If you click your heels together again, you end the "
"effect.    \n"
"When the boots' property has been used for a total of 10 minutes, the magic "
"ceases to function until you finish a long rest. \n"
