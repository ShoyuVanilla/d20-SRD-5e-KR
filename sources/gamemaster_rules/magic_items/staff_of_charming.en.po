"While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 10 "
"charges to cast **_charm person_**, **_command_**, or **_comprehend "
"languages_** from it using your spell save DC. The staff can also be used as "
"a magic quarterstaff.    \n"
"If you are holding the staff and fail a saving throw against an enchantment "
"spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful "
"one. You can't use this property of the staff again until the next dawn. If "
"you succeed on a save against an enchantment spell that targets only you, "
"with or without the staff's intervention, you can use your reaction to "
"expend 1 charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its caster as if "
"you had cast the spell.    \n"
"The staff regains 1d8 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the "
"last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical "
"quarterstaff. \n"
