"This item symbolizes unrepentant evil. A creature that is neither good nor "
"evil in alignment takes 6d6 necrotic damage upon touching the talisman. A "
"good creature takes 8d6 necrotic damage upon touching the talisman. Either "
"sort of creature takes the damage again each time it ends its turn holding "
"or carrying the talisman.    \n"
"If you are an evil cleric or paladin, you can use the talisman as a holy "
"symbol, and you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls while you wear or hold "
"it.    \n"
"The talisman has 6 charges. If you are wearing or holding it, you can use an "
"action to expend 1 charge from the talisman and choose one creature you can "
"see on the ground within 120 feet of you. If the target is of good "
"alignment, a flaming fissure opens under it. The target must succeed on a DC "
"20 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the fissure and be destroyed, leaving "
"no remains. The fissure then closes, leaving no trace of its existence. When "
"you expend the last charge, the talisman dissolves into foul-smelling slime "
"and is destroyed. \n"
