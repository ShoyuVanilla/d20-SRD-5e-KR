"This bag superficially resembles a bag of holding but is a feeding orifice "
"for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes "
"the orifice.    \n"
"The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is "
"placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag "
"is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in "
"the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent "
"chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag "
"can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength "
"check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag to pull a "
"creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check (provided it "
"isn't pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside "
"the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.    \n"
"Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of "
"such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside "
"it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The GM determines the "
"time and plane.    \n"
"If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained "
"within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane. \n"
