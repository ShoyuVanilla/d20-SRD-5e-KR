"This ring stores spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned wearer "
"uses them. The ring can store up to 5 levels worth of spells at a time. When "
"found, it contains 1d6 âˆ’ 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.    \n"
"Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into the ring by "
"touching the ring as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than "
"to be stored in the ring. If the ring can't hold the spell, the spell is "
"expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell "
"determines how much space it uses.    \n"
"While wearing this ring, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses "
"the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability "
"of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the "
"spell. The spell cast from the ring is no longer stored in it, freeing up "
"space. \n"
