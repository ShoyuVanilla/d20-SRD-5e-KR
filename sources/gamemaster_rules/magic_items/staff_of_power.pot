"This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to "
"attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus "
"to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.    \n"
"The staff has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 2d8 "
"+ 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a "
"d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls but "
"loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regains 1d8 + 2 charges.    "
"\n"
"**Power Strike.** When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can "
"expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 force damage to the target.    \n"
"**Spells.** While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or "
"more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your "
"spell save DC and spell attack bonus: **_cone of cold_** (5 charges), "
"**_fireball_** (5th-level version, 5 charges), **_globe of "
"invulnerability_** (6 charges), **_hold monster_** (5 charges), "
"**_levitate_** (2 charges), **_lightning bolt_** (5th-level version, 5 "
"charges), **_magic missile_** (1 charge), **_ray of enfeeblement_** (1 "
"charge), or **_wall of force_** (5 charges).    \n"
"**Retributive Strike.** You can use an action to break the staff over your "
"knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff "
"is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands "
"to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.    \n"
"You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of "
"existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take "
"force damage equal to 16 Ã— the number of charges in the staff. Every other "
"creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed "
"save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from "
"the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, "
"a creature takes half as much damage. \n"
