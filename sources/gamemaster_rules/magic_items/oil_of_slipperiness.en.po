"This sticky black unguent is thick and heavy in the container, but it flows "
"quickly when poured. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along "
"with the equipment it's wearing and carrying (one additional vial is "
"required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 "
"minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of a **_freedom of "
"movement_** spell for 8 hours.    \n"
"Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where it "
"covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the effect of the **_grease_** spell in "
"that area for 8 hours.\n"
