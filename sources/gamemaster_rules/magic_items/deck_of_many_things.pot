"Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made "
"of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen "
"cards, but the rest have twenty-two.    \n"
"Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw "
"and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to "
"simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no "
"effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes "
"effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous "
"draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards "
"fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.    \n"
"Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool "
"or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw "
"the same card twice. \n"

"**Balance.** Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your "
"alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice "
"versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on "
"you.    \n"
"**Comet.** If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group "
"of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one "
"level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.    \n"
"**Donjon.** You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended "
"animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and "
"carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You "
"remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't "
"be located by any divination magic, but a wish spell can reveal the location "
"of your prison. You draw no more cards.    \n"
"**Euryale.** The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a −2 penalty "
"on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The "
"Fates card can end this curse.    \n"
"**The Fates.** Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to "
"avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's "
"magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you "
"die. Flames. A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin "
"and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay "
"you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.    \n"
"**Fool.** You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck "
"again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that "
"much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that "
"leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.    \n"
"**Gem.** Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems "
"worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.    \n"
"**Idiot.** Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum "
"score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.    "
"\n"
"**Jester.** You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond "
"your declared draws.    \n"
"**Key.** A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears "
"in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.    \n"
"**Knight.** You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a "
"space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as "
"you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him "
"or her to you. You control this character.    \n"
"**Moon.** You are granted the ability to cast the **_wish_** spell 1d3 "
"times.    \n"
"**Rogue.** A nonplayer character of the GM's choice becomes hostile toward "
"you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone "
"else reveals it. Nothing less than a **_wish_** spell or divine intervention "
"can end the NPC's hostility toward you.    \n"
"**Ruin.** All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, "
"are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land "
"you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation "
"that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.    "
"\n"
"**Skull.** You summon an avatar of death--a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad "
"in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a "
"space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all "
"others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die "
"or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to "
"help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an "
"avatar of death can't be restored to life. \n"

"**Vizier.** At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you "
"can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to "
"that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling "
"problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on "
"how to apply it.    \n"
"**The Void.** This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your "
"body and contained in an object in a place of the GM's choice. One or more "
"powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, "
"your body is incapacitated. A wish spell can't restore your soul, but the "
"spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more "
"cards. \n"
