"A **spell scroll** bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical "
"cipher. If the spell is on your class's spell list, you can use an action to "
"read the scroll and cast its spell without having to provide any of the "
"spell's components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible.   \n"
"If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than you "
"can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting "
"ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + "
"the spell's level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll "
"with no other effect.    \n"
"Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself "
"crumbles to dust.    \n"
"The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell's saving throw DC "
"and attack bonus, as well as the scroll's rarity, as shown in the Spell "
"Scroll table. \n"

"A wizard spell on a **spell scroll** can be copied just as spells in "
"spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a **spell scroll**, "
"the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to "
"10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully "
"copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the **spell scroll** is "
"destroyed."
