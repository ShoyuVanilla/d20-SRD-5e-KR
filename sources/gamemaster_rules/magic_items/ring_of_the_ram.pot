"This ring has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at "
"dawn. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to expend 1 to 3 of its "
"charges to attack one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The ring "
"produces a spectral ram's head and makes its attack roll with a +7 bonus. On "
"a hit, for each charge you spend, the target takes 2d10 force damage and is "
"pushed 5 feet away from you.    \n"
"Alternatively, you can expend 1 to 3 of the ring's charges as an action to "
"try to break an object you can see within 60 feet of you that isn't being "
"worn or carried. The ring makes a Strength check with a +5 bonus for each "
"charge you spend. \n"
