"You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic "
"weapon. In addition, while you are attuned to this weapon, your hit point "
"maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained.    \n"
"**Curse.** This axe is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse "
"to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the "
"axe, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on "
"attack rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe is within 60 "
"feet of you that you can see or hear.    \n"
"Whenever a hostile creature damages you while the axe is in your possession, "
"you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While "
"berserk, you must use your action each round to attack the creature nearest "
"to you with the axe. If you can make extra attacks as part of the Attack "
"action, you use those extra attacks, moving to attack the next nearest "
"creature after you fell your current target. If you have multiple possible "
"targets, you attack one at random. You are berserk until you start your turn "
"with no creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear. \n"
