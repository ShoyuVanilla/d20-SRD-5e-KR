"Smoke leaks from the lead-stoppered mouth of this brass bottle, which weighs "
"1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick "
"smoke pours out in a 60-foot radius from the bottle. The cloud's area is "
"heavily obscured. Each minute the bottle remains open and within the cloud, "
"the radius increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum radius of 120 "
"feet.    \n"
"The cloud persists as long as the bottle is open. Closing the bottle "
"requires you to speak its command word as an action. Once the bottle is "
"closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes. A moderate wind (11 to 20 "
"miles per hour) can also disperse the smoke after 1 minute, and a strong "
"wind (21 or more miles per hour) can do so after 1 round. \n"
