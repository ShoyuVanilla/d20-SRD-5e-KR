"You can use an action to speak this staff's command word and throw the staff "
"on the ground within 10 feet of you. The staff becomes a giant constrictor "
"snake under your control and acts on its own initiative count. By using a "
"bonus action to speak the command word again, you return the staff to its "
"normal form in a space formerly occupied by the snake.    \n"
"On your turn, you can mentally command the snake if it is within 60 feet of "
"you and you aren't incapacitated. You decide what action the snake takes and "
"where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, "
"such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.    \n"
"If the snake is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies and reverts to its staff "
"form. The staff then shatters and is destroyed. If the snake reverts to "
"staff form before losing all its hit points, it regains all of them. \n"
