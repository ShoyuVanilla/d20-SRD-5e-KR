"This book describes fitness exercises, and its words are charged with "
"magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the "
"book's contents and practicing its guidelines, your Strength score increases "
"by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, "
"but regains it in a century."
