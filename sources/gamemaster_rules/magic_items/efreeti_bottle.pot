"This painted brass bottle weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove "
"the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle. At the end of "
"your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an "
"efreeti appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.    \n"
"The first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls to determine what "
