"This ordinary bag, made from gray, rust, or tan cloth, appears "
"empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a small, "
"fuzzy object. The bag weighs 1/2 pound.    \n"
"You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up "
"to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you "
"determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the "
"bag's color.    \n"
"The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your "
"turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what "
"action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to "
"attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a "
"fashion appropriate to its nature.    \n"
"Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can't be "
"used again until the next dawn. \n"
