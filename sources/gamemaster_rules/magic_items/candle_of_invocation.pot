"The candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an "
"action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it "
"out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments "
"of 1 minute from the candle's total burn time.    \n"
"While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature "
"within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes attack "
"rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a "
"cleric or druid in the light whose alignment matches the candle's can cast "
"1st- level spells he or she has prepared without expending spell slots, "
"though the spell's effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot.    \n"
"Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast "
"the **_gate_** spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle. \n"
