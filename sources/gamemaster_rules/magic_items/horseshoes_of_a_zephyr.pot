"These iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all four shoes are "
"affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the "
"creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above the ground. This "
"effect means the creature can cross or stand above non-solid or unstable "
"surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores "
"difficult terrain. In addition, the creature can move at normal speed for up "
"to 12 hours a day without suffering exhaustion from a forced march."
