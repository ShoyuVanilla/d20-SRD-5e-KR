"While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the **_detect "
"thoughts_** spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain "
"concentration on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic "
"message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply--using a bonus action "
"to do so--while your focus on it continues.    \n"
"While focusing on a creature with **_detect thoughts_**, you can use an "
"action to cast the **_suggestion_** spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that "
"creature. Once used, the **_suggestion_** property can't be used again until "
"the next dawn. \n"
