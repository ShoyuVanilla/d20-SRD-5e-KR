"An **arrow of slaying** is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of "
"creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both "
"**arrows of dragon slaying** and **arrows of blue dragon slaying**. If a "
"creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an **arrow of "
"slaying** takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 "
"Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed "
"save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.    \n"
"Once an **arrow of slaying** deals its extra damage to a creature, it "
"becomes a nonmagical arrow.    \n"
"Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as **bolts of "
"slaying** meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.\n"
