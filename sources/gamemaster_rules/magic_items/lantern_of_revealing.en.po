"While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil, shedding "
"bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 "
"feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible as long as they are in the "
"lantern's bright light. You can use an action to lower the hood, reducing "
"the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius."
