"While holding this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon "
"attacks.    \n"
"**Curse.** This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are "
"targeted by the **_remove curse_** spell or similar magic. Removing the "
"shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is "
"made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become "
"the target instead. \n"
