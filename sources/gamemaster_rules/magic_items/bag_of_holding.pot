"This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside "
"dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag "
"can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag "
"weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the "
"bag requires an action.    \n"
"If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, "
"and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned "
"inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put "
"right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can "
"survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of "
"creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.    "
"\n"
"Placing a **bag of holding** inside an extradimensional space created by a "
"**handy haversack**, **portable hole**, or similar item instantly destroys "
"both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where "
"the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the "
"gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate "
"then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened. \n"
