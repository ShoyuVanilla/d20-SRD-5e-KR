"This backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is an "
"extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of "
"material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch "
"can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always "
"weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.    \n"
"Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting "
"with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an "
"action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is "
"always magically on top.    \n"
"The haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp "
"object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If "
"the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an "
"artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside "
"out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right "
"before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the "
"haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time "
"it begins to suffocate.    \n"
"Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a **bag of "
"holding**, **portable hole**, or similar item instantly destroys both items "
"and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item "
"was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is "
"sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral "
"Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be "
"reopened.\n"
