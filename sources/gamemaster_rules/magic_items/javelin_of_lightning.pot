"This javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and speak its command word, "
"it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that "
"extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in the line "
"excluding you and the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, "
"taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a "
"successful one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when it reaches "
"the target. Make a ranged weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the "
"target takes damage from the javelin plus 4d6 lightning damage.    \n"
"The javelin's property can't be used again until the next dawn. In the "
"meantime, the javelin can still be used as a magic weapon.\n"
