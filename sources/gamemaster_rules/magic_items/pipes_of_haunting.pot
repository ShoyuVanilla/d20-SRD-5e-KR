"You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. They have 3 "
"charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an "
"eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you "
"play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you "
"for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren't hostile "
"toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. A creature that fails "
"the saving throw can repeat it at the end of each of its turns, ending the "
"effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw "
"is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain 1d3 "
"expended charges daily at dawn."
