"This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action to "
"detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of "
"its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level **_fireball_** spell (save "
"DC 15).    \n"
"You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When "
"you do so, increase the level of the **_fireball_** by 1 for each bead "
"beyond the first.\n"
