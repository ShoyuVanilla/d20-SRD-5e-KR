"This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace that grants a "
"+3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties "
"associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the "
"haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.    \n"
"**Six Buttons.** You can press one of the rod's six buttons as a bonus "
"action. A button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until "
"you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal "
"form.    \n"
"If you press **button 1**, the rod becomes a **flame tongue**, as a fiery "
"blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head.    \n"
"If you press **button 2**, the rod's flanged head folds down and two "
"crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic "
"battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.    "
"\n"
"If you press **button 3**, the rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point "
"springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot "
"haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to "
"attack and damage rolls made with it.    \n"
"If you press **button 4**, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 "
"feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the "
"bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches "
"long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can "
"bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the "
"rod to revert to its normal form.    \n"
"If you press **button 5**, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram "
"and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through "
"doors, barricades, and other barriers.    \n"
"If you press **button 6**, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and "
"indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is "
"used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you "
"knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above "
"it.    \n"
"**Drain Life.** When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, "
"you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a "
"failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a "
"number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can't "
"be used again until the next dawn.    \n"
"**Paralyze.** When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you "
"can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, "
"the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw "
"at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This "
"property can't be used again until the next dawn.    \n"
"**Terrify.** While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each "
"creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving "
"throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute. A "
"frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its "
"turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can't be used "
"again until the next dawn. \n"
