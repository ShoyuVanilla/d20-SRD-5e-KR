"Each of the quiver's three compartments connects to an extradimensional "
"space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing "
"more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to sixty arrows, "
"bolts, or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to eighteen "
"javelins or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to six long "
"objects, such as bows, quarterstaffs, or spears.    \n"
"You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular "
"quiver or scabbard. \n"
