"This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to "
"attack and damage rolls made with it. While you hold it, you gain a +2 bonus "
"to spell attack rolls.    \n"
"The staff has 50 charges for the following properties. It regains 4d6 + 2 "
"expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a "
"d20. On a 20, the staff regains 1d12 + 1 charges.    \n"
"**Spell Absorption.** While holding the staff, you have advantage on saving "
"throws against spells. In addition, you can use your reaction when another "
"creature casts a spell that targets only you. If you do, the staff absorbs "
"the magic of the spell, canceling its effect and gaining a number of charges "
"equal to the absorbed spell's level. However, if doing so brings the staff's "
"total number of charges above 50, the staff explodes as if you activated its "
"retributive strike (see below).    \n"
"**Spells.** While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of "
"its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell "
"save DC and spellcasting ability: **_conjure elemental (7 charges), "
"**_dispel magic (3 charges), **_fireball (7th-level version, 7 charges), "
"**_flaming sphere (2 charges), **_ice storm (4 charges), **_invisibility_** "
"(2 charges), **_knock_** (2 charges), **_lightning bolt_** (7th-level "
"version, 7 charges), **_passwall_** (5 charges), **_plane shift_** (7 "
"charges), **_telekinesis_** (5 charges), **_wall of fire_** (4 charges), or "
"**_web_** (2 charges).    \n"
"You can also use an action to cast one of the following spells from the "
"staff without using any charges: **_arcane lock_**, **_detect magic_**, "
"**_enlarge/reduce_**, **_light_**, **_mage hand_**, or **_protection from "
"evil and good_**.    \n"
"**Retributive Strike.** You can use an action to break the staff over your "
"knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff "
"is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands "
"to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.    \n"
"You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of "
"existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take "
"force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other "
"creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed "
"save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from "
"the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, "
"a creature takes half as much damage. \n"
