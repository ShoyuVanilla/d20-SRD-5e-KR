"While holding this shield, you can speak its command word as a bonus action "
"to cause it to animate. The shield leaps into the air and hovers in your "
"space to protect you as if you were wielding it, leaving your hands "
"free. The shield remains animated for 1 minute, until you use a bonus action "
"to end this effect, or until you are incapacitated or die, at which point "
"the shield falls to the ground or into your hand if you have one free."
