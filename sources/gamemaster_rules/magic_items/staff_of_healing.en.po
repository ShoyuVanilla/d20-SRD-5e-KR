"This staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend "
"1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using "
"your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier: **_cure wounds_** (1 "
"charge per spell level, up to 4th), **_lesser restoration_** (2 charges), or "
"**_mass cure wounds_** (5 charges).    \n"
"The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the "
"last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff vanishes in a flash of light, "
"lost forever. \n"
