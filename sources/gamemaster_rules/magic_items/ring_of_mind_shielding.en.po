"While wearing this ring, you are immune to magic that allows other creatures "
"to read your thoughts, determine whether you are lying, know your alignment, "
"or know your creature type. Creatures can telepathically communicate with "
"you only if you allow it.    \n"
"You can use an action to cause the ring to become invisible until you use "
"another action to make it visible, until you remove the ring, or until you "
"die.    \n"
"If you die while wearing the ring, your soul enters it, unless it already "
"houses a soul. You can remain in the ring or depart for the afterlife. As "
"long as your soul is in the ring, you can telepathically communicate with "
"any creature wearing it. A wearer can't prevent this telepathic "
"communication. \n"
