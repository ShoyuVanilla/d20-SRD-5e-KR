"While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. You can also use a "
"bonus action to speak the armor's command word and cause the armor to assume "
"the appearance of a normal set of clothing or some other kind of armor. You "
"decide what it looks like, including color, style, and accessories, but the "
"armor retains its normal bulk and weight. The illusory appearance lasts "
"until you use this property again or remove the armor."
