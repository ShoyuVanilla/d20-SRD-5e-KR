"This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to "
"attack and damage rolls made with it. It also has the following additional "
"properties. When one of these properties is used, it can't be used again "
"until the next dawn.    \n"
"**Lightning.** When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can "
"cause the target to take an extra 2d6 lightning damage.    \n"
"**Thunder.** When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can cause "
"the staff to emit a crack of thunder, audible out to 300 feet. The target "
"you hit must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become stunned "
"until the end of your next turn.    \n"
"**Lightning Strike.** You can use an action to cause a bolt of lightning to "
"leap from the staff's tip in a line that is 5 feet wide and 120 feet "
"long. Each creature in that line must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, "
"taking 9d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a "
"successful one.    \n"
"**Thunderclap.** You can use an action to cause the staff to issue a "
"deafening thunderclap, audible out to 600 feet. Each creature within 60 feet "
"of you (not including you) must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a "
"failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 1 "
"minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't "
"deafened.    \n"
"**Thunder and Lightning.** You can use an action to use the Lightning Strike "
"and Thunderclap properties at the same time. Doing so doesn't expend the "
"daily use of those properties, only the use of this one. \n"
