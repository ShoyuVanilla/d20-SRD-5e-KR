"Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing "
"1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional "
"objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush "
"to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.    \n"
"Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, "
"which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features--such as a door, "
"a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons-- that are up to 10,000 "
"cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.    \n"
"When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted "
"becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates "
"an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a "
"floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of "
"objects you create.    \n"
"Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you "
"paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the "
"object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, "
"bone, or some other worthless material.    \n"
"If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears "
"but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to "
"anything. \n"
