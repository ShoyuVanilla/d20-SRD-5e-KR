"Found in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It appears "
"to be **dust of disappearance**, and an **_identify_** spell reveals it to "
"be such. There is enough of it for one use.    \n"
"When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and "
"each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a "
"DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe, while sneezing "
"uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and "
"suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving "
"throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a "
"success. The **_lesser restoration_** spell can also end the effect on a "
"creature. \n"
