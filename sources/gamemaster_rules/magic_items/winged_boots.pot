"While you wear these boots, you have a flying speed equal to your walking "
"speed. You can use the boots to fly for up to 4 hours, all at once or in "
"several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the "
"duration. If you are flying when the duration expires, you descend at a rate "
"of 30 feet per round until you land.    \n"
"The boots regain 2 hours of flying capability for every 12 hours they aren't "
"in use. \n"
