"This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to "
"attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you have a +2 bonus "
"to spell attack rolls.    \n"
"The staff has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 4 "
"expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a "
"d20. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical "
"quarterstaff.    \n"
"**Spells.** You can use an action to expend 1 or more of the staff's charges "
"to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: "
"**_animal friendship_** (1 charge), **_awaken_** (5 charges), **_barkskin_** "
"(2 charges), **_locate animals or plants_** (2 charges), **_speak with "
"animals_** (1 charge), **_speak with plants_** (3 charges), or **_wall of "
"thorns_** (6 charges).    \n"
"You can also use an action to cast the **_pass without trace_** spell from "
"the staff without using any charges.    \n"
"**Tree Form.** You can use an action to plant one end of the staff in "
"fertile earth and expend 1 charge to transform the staff into a healthy "
"tree. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its "
"branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius. The tree appears "
"ordinary but radiates a faint aura of transmutation magic if targeted by "
"**_detect magic_**. While touching the tree and using another action to "
"speak its command word, you return the staff to its normal form. Any "
"creature in the tree falls when it reverts to a staff. \n"
