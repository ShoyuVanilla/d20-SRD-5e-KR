"This item appears to be a longsword hilt. While grasping the hilt, you can "
"use a bonus action to cause a blade of pure radiance to spring into "
"existence, or make the blade disappear. While the blade exists, this magic "
"longsword has the finesse property. If you are proficient with shortswords "
"or longswords, you are proficient with the **sun blade**.    \n"
"You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which "
"deals radiant damage instead of slashing damage. When you hit an undead with "
"it, that target takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.    \n"
"The sword's luminous blade emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim "
"light for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the blade "
"persists, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and "
"dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 "
"feet each. \n"
