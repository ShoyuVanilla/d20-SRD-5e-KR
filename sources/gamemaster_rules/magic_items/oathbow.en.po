"When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in Elvish, \"Swift defeat to "
"my enemies.\" When you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can, as "
"a command phrase, say, \"Swift death to you who have wronged me.\" The "
"target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn "
"seven days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. When "
"your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn.    \n"
"When you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon against your sworn "
"enemy, you have advantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no "
"benefit from cover, other than total cover, and you suffer no disadvantage "
"due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra 3d6 "
"piercing damage.    \n"
"While your sworn enemy lives, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with all "
"other weapons. \n"
