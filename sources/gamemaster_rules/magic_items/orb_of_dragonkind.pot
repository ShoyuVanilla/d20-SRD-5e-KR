"Ages past, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When "
"the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked their "
"greatest magic, forging five **Orbs of Dragonkind** (or **Dragon Orbs**) to "
"help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five wizard "
"towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious "
"end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the "
"dragons with powerful magic.    \n"
"As the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded "
"into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been "
"warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of "
"calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control "
"over dragons.    \n"
"Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any "
"attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might "
"find themselves enslaved to an orb.    \n"
"An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it "
"grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.    \n"
"While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths "
"and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a "
"successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to "
"it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you "
"remain attuned to it.    \n"
"While you are charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your attunement "
"to it, and the orb casts **_suggestion_** on you at will (save DC 18), "
"urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence "
"within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular "
"people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance "
"the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides. \n"

"### Spells. \n"
"The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If "
"you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to "
"cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: **_cure wounds_** "
"(5th-level version, 3 charges), **_daylight_** (1 charge), **_death ward_** "
"(2 charges), or **_scrying_** (3 charges).    \n"
"You can also use an action to cast the **_detect magic_** spell from the orb "
"without using any charges.    \n"
"**Call Dragons.** While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause "
"the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for "
"40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as "
"possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are "
"unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward "
"you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this "
"property, it can't be used again for 1 hour.    \n"
"**Destroying an Orb.** An **Orb of Dragonkind** appears fragile but is "
"impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of "
"dragons. A **_disintegrate_** spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon "
"is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.\n"
