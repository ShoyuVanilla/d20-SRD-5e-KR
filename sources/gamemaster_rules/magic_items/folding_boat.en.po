"This object appears as a wooden box that measures 12 inches long, 6 inches "
"wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be opened to "
"store items inside. This item also has three command words, each requiring "
"you to use an action to speak it.    \n"
"One command word causes the box to unfold into a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet "
"wide, and 2 feet deep. The boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and "
"a lateen sail. The boat can hold up to four Medium creatures comfortably.    "
"\n"
"The second command word causes the box to unfold into a ship 24 feet long, 8 "
"feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The ship has a deck, rowing seats, five sets of "
"oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square "
"sail. The ship can hold fifteen Medium creatures comfortably.     \n"
"When the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel "
"its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the boat.    \n"
"The third command word causes the **folding boat** to fold back into a box, "
"provided that no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel that can't "
"fit inside the box remain outside the box as it folds. Any objects in the "
"vessel that can fit inside the box do so. \n"
