"While wearing this ring in dim light or darkness, you can cast **_dancing "
"lights_** and **_light_** from the ring at will. Casting either spell from "
"the ring requires an action.    \n"
"The ring has 6 charges for the following other properties. The ring regains "
"1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.    \n"
"**Faerie Fire.** You can expend 1 charge as an action to cast **_faerie "
"fire_** from the ring.   \n"
"**Ball Lightning.** You can expend 2 charges as an action to create one to "
"four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning. The more spheres you create, the "
"less powerful each sphere is individually.    \n"
"Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of "
"you. The spheres last as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a "
"spell), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius.    "
"\n"
"As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther "
"than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other than you comes within 5 "
"feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and "
"disappears. That creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a "
"failed save, the creature takes lightning damage based on the number of "
"spheres you created. \n"

"**Shooting Stars.** You can expend 1 to 3 charges as an action. For every "
"charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a "
"point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature within a 15-foot cube "
"originating from that point is showered in sparks and must make a DC 15 "
"Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as "
