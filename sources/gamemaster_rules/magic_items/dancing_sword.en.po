"You can use a bonus action to toss this magic sword into the air and speak "
"the command word. When you do so, the sword begins to hover, flies up to 30 "
"feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The sword "
"uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls.    \n"
"While the sword hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to "
"30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus "
"action, you can cause the sword to attack one creature within 5 feet of it.    "
"\n"
"After the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it flies up to 30 feet "
"and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, it falls to the "
"ground at your feet. If the sword has no unobstructed path to you, it moves "
"as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to "
"hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it. \n"
