"When you drink this potion, your Strength score changes for 1 hour. The type "
"of giant determines the score (see the table below). The potion has no "
"effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.    \n"
"This potion's transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail "
"from a giant of the appropriate type. The **potion of frost giant strength** "
"and the **potion of stone giant strength** have the same effect. \n"
