"Dragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes "
"dragons collect their cast-off scales and gift them to humanoids. Other "
"times, hunters carefully skin and preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In "
"either case, dragon scale mail is highly valued.    \n"
"While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage on "
"saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, "
"and you have resistance to one damage type that is determined by the kind of "
"dragon that provided the scales (see the table).    \n"
"Additionally, you can focus your senses as an action to magically discern "
"the distance and direction to the closest dragon within 30 miles of you that "
"is of the same type as the armor. This special action can't be used again "
"until the next dawn. \n"
