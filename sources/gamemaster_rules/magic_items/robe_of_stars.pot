"This black or dark blue robe is embroidered with small white or silver "
"stars. You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws while you wear it.    \n"
"Six stars, located on the robe's upper front portion, are particularly "
"large. While wearing this robe, you can use an action to pull off one of the "
"stars and use it to cast **_magic missile_** as a 5th-level spell. Daily at "
"dusk, 1d6 removed stars reappear on the robe.    \n"
"While you wear the robe, you can use an action to enter the Astral Plane "
"along with everything you are wearing and carrying. You remain there until "
"you use an action to return to the plane you were on. You reappear in the "
"last space you occupied, or if that space is occupied, the nearest "
"unoccupied space. \n"
