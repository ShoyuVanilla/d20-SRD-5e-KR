"Found in a small packet, this powder resembles very fine sand. There is "
"enough of it for one use. When you use an action to throw the dust into the "
"air, you and each creature and object within 10 feet of you become invisible "
"for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is "
"consumed when its magic takes effect. If a creature affected by the dust "
"attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility ends for that creature."
