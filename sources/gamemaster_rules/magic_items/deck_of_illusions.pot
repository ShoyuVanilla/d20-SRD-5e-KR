"This box contains a set of parchment cards. A full deck has 34 cards. A deck "
"found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 âˆ’ 1 cards.    \n"
"The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can "
"use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use an "
"action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at "
"a point within 30 feet of you.    \n"
"An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains "
"until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, "
"and behaves as if it were a real creature except that it can do no "
"harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, "
"you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its "
"card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be "
"an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to "
"visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC "
"15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears "
"translucent.    \n"
"The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is "
"dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and "
"that card can't be used again.\n"
