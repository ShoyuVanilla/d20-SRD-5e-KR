"This flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use an action to press "
"the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until "
"you or another creature uses an action to push the button again, the rod "
"doesn't move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 "
"pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A "
"creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the fixed "
"rod up to 10 feet on a success."
