"This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in "
"space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.    \n"
"The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that "
"passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is "
"susceptible to damage from a **sphere of annihilation**, it passes through "
"the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly "
"engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.    \n"
"The sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 "
"feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25 "
"Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one "
"direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 Ã— your "
"Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 "
"feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a "
"DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.    "
"\n"
"If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature's control, "
"you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other creature's "
"Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the "
"sphere and can levitate it as normal.    \n"
"If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created "
"by the **_gate_** spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a "
"**portable hole**, the GM determines randomly what happens, using the "
"following table. \n"
