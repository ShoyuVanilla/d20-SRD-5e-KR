"You can use a bonus action to speak this magic sword's command word, causing "
"flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot "
"radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the sword is ablaze, "
"it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage to any target it hits. The flames last "
"until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you "
"drop or sheathe the sword."
