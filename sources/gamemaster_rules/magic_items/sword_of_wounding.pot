"Hit points lost to this weapon's damage can be regained only through a short "
"or long rest, rather than by regeneration, magic, or any other means.    \n"
"Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using this magic "
"weapon, you can wound the target. At the start of each of the wounded "
"creature's turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time you've wounded "
"it, and it can then make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending the "
"effect of all such wounds on itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded "
"creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC "
"15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a "
"success.\n"
