"You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.    "
"\n"
"The first time you attack with the sword on each of your turns, you can "
"transfer some or all of the sword's bonus to your Armor Class, instead of "
"using the bonus on any attacks that turn. For example, you could reduce the "
"bonus to your attack and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to AC. The "
"adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, "
"although you must hold the sword to gain a bonus to AC from it. \n"
