"While wearing this ring, you can use an action to speak its command "
"word. When you do so, you can see into and through solid matter for 1 "
"minute. This vision has a radius of 30 feet. To you, solid objects within "
"that radius appear transparent and don't prevent light from passing through "
"them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or "
"up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a "
"thin sheet of lead.    \n"
"Whenever you use the ring again before taking a long rest, you must succeed "
"on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion. \n"
