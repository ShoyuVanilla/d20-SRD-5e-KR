"These gloves seem to almost meld into your hands when you don them. When a "
"ranged weapon attack hits you while you're wearing them, you can use your "
"reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier, provided "
"that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the "
"missile if it is small enough for you to hold in that hand."
