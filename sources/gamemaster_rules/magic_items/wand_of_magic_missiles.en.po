"This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 "
"or more of its charges to cast the **_magic missile_** spell from it. For 1 "
"charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. You can increase the "
"spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.    \n"
"The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the "
"wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is "
"destroyed.\n"
