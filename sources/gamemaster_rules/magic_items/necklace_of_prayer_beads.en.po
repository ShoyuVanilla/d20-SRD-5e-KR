"This necklace has 1d4 + 2 magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl, or "
"topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, "
"bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magic bead is "
"removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic.    \n"
"Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on the "
"necklace or determines it randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead "
"of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead "
"contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus action (using your "
"spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead's spell is cast, "
"that bead can't be used again until the next dawn. \n"
