"This magic weapon has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and "
"expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror. Each creature of your choice in "
"a 30-foot radius extending from you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving "
"throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While it is frightened in "
"this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from "
"you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of "
"you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash "
"action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it "
"has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end "
"of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the "
"effect on itself on a success.    \n"
"The mace regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\n"
