"While you wear this cloak, it projects an illusion that makes you appear to "
"be standing in a place near your actual location, causing any creature to "
"have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. If you take damage, the "
"property ceases to function until the start of your next turn. This property "
"is suppressed while you are incapacitated, restrained, or otherwise unable "
"to move."
