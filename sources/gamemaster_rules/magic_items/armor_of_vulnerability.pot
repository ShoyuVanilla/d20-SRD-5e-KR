"While wearing this armor, you have resistance to one of the following damage "
"types: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. The GM chooses the type or "
"determines it randomly.    \n"
"**Curse.** This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an "
"**_identify_** spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to "
"the armor curses you until you are targeted by the **_remove curse_** spell "
"or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, "
"you have vulnerability to two of the three damage types associated with the "
"armor (not the one to which it grants resistance). \n"
