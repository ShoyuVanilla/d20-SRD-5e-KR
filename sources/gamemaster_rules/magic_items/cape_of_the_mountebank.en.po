"This cape smells faintly of brimstone. While wearing it, you can use it to "
"cast the **_dimension door_** spell as an action. This property of the cape "
"can't be used again until the next dawn.    \n"
"When you disappear, you leave behind a cloud of smoke, and you appear in a "
"similar cloud of smoke at your destination. The smoke lightly obscures the "
"space you left and the space you appear in, and it dissipates at the end of "
"your next turn. A light or stronger wind disperses the smoke.\n"
