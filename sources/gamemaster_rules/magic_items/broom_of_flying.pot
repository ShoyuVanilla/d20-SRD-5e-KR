"This wooden broom, which weighs 3 pounds, functions like a mundane broom "
"until you stand astride it and speak its command word. It then hovers "
"beneath you and can be ridden in the air. It has a flying speed of 50 "
"feet. It can carry up to 400 pounds, but its flying speed becomes 30 feet "
"while carrying over 200 pounds. The broom stops hovering when you land.    "
"\n"
"You can send the broom to travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of you "
"if you speak the command word, name the location, and are familiar with that "
"place. The broom comes back to you when you speak another command word, "
"provided that the broom is still within 1 mile of you.\n"
