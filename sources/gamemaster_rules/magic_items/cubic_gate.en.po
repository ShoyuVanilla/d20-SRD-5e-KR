"This cube is 3 inches across and radiates palpable magical energy. The six "
"sides of the cube are each keyed to a different plane of existence, one of "
"which is the Material Plane. The other sides are linked to planes determined "
"by the GM.    \n"
"You can use an action to press one side of the cube to cast the **_gate_** "
"spell with it, opening a portal to the plane keyed to that "
"side. Alternatively, if you use an action to press one side twice, you can "
"cast the **_plane shift_** spell (save DC 17) with the cube and transport "
"the targets to the plane keyed to that side.    \n"
"The cube has 3 charges. Each use of the cube expends 1 charge. The cube "
"regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\t\n"
