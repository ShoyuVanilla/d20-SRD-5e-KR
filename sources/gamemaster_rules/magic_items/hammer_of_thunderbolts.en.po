"You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.    "
"\n"
"**Giant's Bane (Requires Attunement).(()) You must be wearing a **belt of "
"giant strength** (any variety) and **gauntlets of ogre power** to attune to "
"this weapon. The attunement ends if you take off either of those "
"items. While you are attuned to this weapon and holding it, your Strength "
"score increases by 4 and can exceed 20, but not 30. When you roll a 20 on an "
"attack roll made with this weapon against a giant, the giant must succeed on "
"a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or die.   \n"
"The hammer also has 5 charges. While attuned to it, you can expend 1 charge "
"and make a ranged weapon attack with the hammer, hurling it as if it had the "
"thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 "
"feet. If the attack hits, the hammer unleashes a thunderclap audible out to "
"300 feet. The target and every creature within 30 feet of it must succeed on "
"a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next "
"turn. The hammer regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. \n"
