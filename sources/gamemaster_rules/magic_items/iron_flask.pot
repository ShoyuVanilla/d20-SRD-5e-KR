"This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the "
"flask's command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60 feet "
"of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one "
"you're on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be "
"trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it "
"has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the "
"flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A "
"creature trapped in the flask doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink and "
"doesn't age.    \n"
"You can use an action to remove the flask's stopper and release the creature "
"the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for "
"1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no commands or "
"give it a command that is likely to result in its death, it defends itself "
"but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature "
"acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.    \n"
"An **_identify_** spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the "
"only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly "
"discovered bottle might already contain a creature chosen by the GM or "
"determined randomly. \n"
