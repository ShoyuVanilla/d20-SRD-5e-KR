"This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a **potion of healing** or "
"other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion "
"magic. An **_identify_** spell reveals its true nature.    \n"
"If you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13 "
"Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. At the start of each of your turns "
"while you are poisoned in this way, you take 3d6 poison damage. At the end "
"of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful "
"save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by "
"1d6. The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0. \n"
