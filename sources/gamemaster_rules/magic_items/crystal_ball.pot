"The typical **crystal ball**, a very rare item, is about 6 inches in "
"diameter. While touching it, you can cast the **_scrying_** spell (save DC "
"17) with it.    \n"
"The following **crystal ball** variants are legendary items and have "
"additional properties.    \n"
"**Crystal Ball of Mind Reading.** You can use an action to cast the "
"**_detect thoughts_** spell (save DC 17) while you are scrying with the "
"**crystal ball**, targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the "
"spell's sensor. You don't need to concentrate on this **_detect thoughts_** "
"to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if **_scrying_** ends.    \n"
"**Crystal Ball of Telepathy.** While scrying with the crystal ball, you can "
"communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the "
"spell's sensor. You can also use an action to cast the **_suggestion_** "
"spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don't "
"need to concentrate on this **_suggestion_** to maintain it during its "
"duration, but it ends if **_scrying_** ends. Once used, the **_suggestion_** "
"power of the crystal ball can't be used again until the next dawn.    \n"
"**Crystal Ball of True Seeing.** While scrying with the crystal ball, you "
"have truesight with a radius of 120 feet centered on the spell's sensor. \n"
