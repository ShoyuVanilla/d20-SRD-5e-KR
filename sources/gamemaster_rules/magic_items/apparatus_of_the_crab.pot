"This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500 "
"pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful "
"DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a "
"hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to "
"crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral "
"position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the "
"apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster. The apparatus of the Crab "
"is a Large object with the following statistics:    \n"
"**Armor Class:** 20    \n"
"**Hit Points:** 200    \n"
"**Speed:** 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail "
"aren't extended)    \n"
"**Damage Immunities:** poison, psychic \n"

"To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the "
"apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The "
"compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the "
"number of breathing creatures inside.    \n"
"The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 "
"feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from "
"pressure.    \n"
"A creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of "
"the apparatus's levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its "
"neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the "
"Apparatus of the Crab Levers table. \n"
