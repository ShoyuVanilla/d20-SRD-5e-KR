"While wearing this ring, you have advantage on saving throws against any "
"spell that targets only you (not in an area of effect). In addition, if you "
"roll a 20 for the save and the spell is 7th level or lower, the spell has no "
"effect on you and instead targets the caster, using the slot level, spell "
"save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the caster."
