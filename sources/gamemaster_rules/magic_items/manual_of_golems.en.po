"This tome contains information and incantations necessary to make a "
"particular type of golem. The GM chooses the type or determines it "
"randomly. To decipher and use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at "
"least two 5th-level spell slots. A creature that can't use a **manual of "
"golems** and attempts to read it takes 6d6 psychic damage."
