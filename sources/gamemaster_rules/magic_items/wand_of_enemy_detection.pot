"This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and expend "
"1 charge to speak its command word. For the next minute, you know the "
"direction of the nearest creature hostile to you within 60 feet, but not its "
"distance from you. The wand can sense the presence of hostile creatures that "
"are ethereal, invisible, disguised, or hidden, as well as those in plain "
"sight. The effect ends if you stop holding the wand.    \n"
"The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the "
"wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is "
"destroyed. \n"
