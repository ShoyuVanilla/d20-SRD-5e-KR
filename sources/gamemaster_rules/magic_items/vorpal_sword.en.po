"You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic "
"weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage.    \n"
"When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and "
"roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The "
"creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is "
"immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn't have or "
"need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides that the creature is "
"too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead "
"takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.\n"
