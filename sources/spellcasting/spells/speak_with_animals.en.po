"You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for "
"the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their "
"intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby "
"locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have "
"perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to "
"perform a small favor for you, at the GM's discretion."
