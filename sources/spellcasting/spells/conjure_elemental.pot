"You call forth an elemental servant. Choose an area of air, earth, fire, or "
"water that fills a 10-foot cube within range. An elemental of challenge "
"rating 5 or lower appropriate to the area you chose appears in an unoccupied "
"space within 10 feet of it. For example, a fire elemental emerges from a "
"bonfire, and an earth elemental rises up from the ground. The elemental "
"disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.    \n"
"The elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll "
"initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal "
"commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't "
"issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself from hostile "
"creatures but otherwise takes no actions.    \n"
"If your concentration is broken, the elemental doesn't disappear. Instead, "
"you lose control of the elemental, it becomes hostile toward you and your "
"companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled elemental can't be "
"dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it. The GM has "
"the elemental's statistics. \n"
