"You write on parchment, paper, or some other suitable writing material and "
"imbue it with a potent illusion that lasts for the duration.    \n"
"To you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the writing "
"appears normal, written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you "
"intended when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing appears as if "
"it were written in an unknown or magical script that is "
"unintelligible. Alternatively, you can cause the writing to appear to be an "
"entirely different message, written in a different hand and language, though "
"the language must be one you know.    \n"
"Should the spell be dispelled, the original script and the illusion both "
"disappear.    \n"
"A creature with truesight can read the hidden message. \n"
