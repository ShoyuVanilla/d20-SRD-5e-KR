"You implant a message within an object in range, a message that is uttered "
"when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that "
"isn't being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, "
"which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as "
"10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell "
"to deliver your message.    \n"
"When that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and "
"recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the "
"object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for "
"example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the "
"words appear to come from the object's mouth. When you cast this spell, you "
"can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and "
"repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.    \n"
"The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, "
"though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 "
"feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when "
"any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings "
"within 30 feet of it. \n"
