"The wood of a club or quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with nature's "
"power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of "
"Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, "
"and the weapon's damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes magical, "
