"You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the "
"duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this "
"spell again.    \n"
"If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It "
"can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, "
"or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the "
"duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the "
"spell ends.    \n"
"If you create an image of an object--such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a "
"small chest--it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create "
"sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with "
"the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.    "
"\n"
"If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature "
"can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence "
"(Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the "
"illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature. \n"
