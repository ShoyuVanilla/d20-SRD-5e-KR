"An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 10-foot "
"radius around you and remains for the duration.    \n"
"Any spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can't affect "
"creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher "
"level spell slot. Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the "
"barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the "
"barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells. \n"
