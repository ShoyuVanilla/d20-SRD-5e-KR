"You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a "
"point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is "
"heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration.    \n"
"Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn "
"must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the "
"creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that "
"don't need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this "
"saving throw.    \n"
"A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 "
"rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 "
"round. \n"
