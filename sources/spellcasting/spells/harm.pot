"You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within "
"range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, "
"it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful "
"save. The damage can't reduce the target's hit points below 1. If the target "
"fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an "
"amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a "
"disease allows a creature's hit point maximum to return to normal before "
"that time passes."
