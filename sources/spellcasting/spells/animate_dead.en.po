"This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of "
"a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with a "
"foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a "
"skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the GM has "
"the creature's game statistics).    \n"
"On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any "
"creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you "
"(if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at "
"the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action "
"the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you "
"can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or "
"corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against "
"hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it "
"until its task is complete.    \n"
"The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops "
"obeying any command you've given it. To maintain control of the creature for "
"another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the "
"current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control "
"over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than "
"animating a new one. \n"

"**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th "
"level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two additional undead "
"creatures for each slot level above 3rd. Each of the creatures must come "
"from a different corpse or pile of bones. \n"
