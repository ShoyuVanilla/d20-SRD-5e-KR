"You and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a "
"gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this "
"cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to "
"damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this "
"form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 "
"minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and can't move. Until "
"the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the "
"1-minute transformation.    \n"
"If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature "
"descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does "
"safely. If it can't land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining "
"distance. \n"
