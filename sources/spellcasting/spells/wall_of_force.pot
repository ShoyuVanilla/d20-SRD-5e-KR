"An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose "
"within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a "
"horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or "
"resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a "
"sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made "
"up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with "
"another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the "
"duration. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the "
"creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).    \n"
"Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and "
"can't be dispelled by **_dispel magic_**. A **_disintegrate_** spell "
"destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the "
"Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall. \n"
