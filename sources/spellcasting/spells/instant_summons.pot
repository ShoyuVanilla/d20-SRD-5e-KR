"You touch an object weighing 10 pounds or less whose longest dimension is 6 "
"feet or less. The spell leaves an invisible mark on its surface and "
"invisibly inscribes the name of the item on the sapphire you use as the "
"material component. Each time you cast this spell, you must use a different "
"sapphire.    \n"
"At any time thereafter, you can use your action to speak the item's name and "
"crush the sapphire. The item instantly appears in your hand regardless of "
"physical or planar distances, and the spell ends.    \n"
"If another creature is holding or carrying the item, crushing the sapphire "
"doesn't transport the item to you, but instead you learn who the creature "
"possessing the object is and roughly where that creature is located at that "
"moment.    \n"
"**_Dispel magic_** or a similar effect successfully applied to the sapphire "
"ends this spell's effect. \n"
