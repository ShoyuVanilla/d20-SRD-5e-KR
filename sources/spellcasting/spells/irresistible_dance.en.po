"Choose one creature that you can see within range. The target begins a comic "
"dance in place: shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering for the "
"duration. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this spell.    \n"
"A dancing creature must use all its movement to dance without leaving its "
"space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack "
"rolls. While the target is affected by this spell, other creatures have "
"advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing creature makes "
"a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself. On a successful save, the "
"spell ends.\n"
