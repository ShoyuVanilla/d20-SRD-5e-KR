"You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to "
"a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is a "
"circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can "
"orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the "
"duration.    \n"
"The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel "
"through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything "
"that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the "
"unoccupied space nearest to the portal.    \n"
"Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell "
"from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.    \n"
"When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a "
"pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn't work). If that creature is on a plane "
"other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named creature's "
"immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the nearest "
"unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special power over "
"the creature, and it is free to act as the GM deems appropriate. It might "
"leave, attack you, or help you. \n"
