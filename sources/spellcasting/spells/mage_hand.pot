"A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The "
"hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand "
"vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this "
"spell again.    \n"
"You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to "
"manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve "
"an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can "
"move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.    \n"
"The hand can't attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 "
"pounds. \n"
