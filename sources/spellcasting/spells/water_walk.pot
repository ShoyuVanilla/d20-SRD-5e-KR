"This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface--such as "
"water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava--as if it were harmless solid "
"ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the "
"heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this "
"ability for the duration.    \n"
"If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the target "
"to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round. \n"
