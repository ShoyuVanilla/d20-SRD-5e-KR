"You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with "
"needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and "
"lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 "
"feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is "
"up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.    \n"
"When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity "
"saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8 piercing damage, or "
"half as much damage on a successful save.    \n"
"A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every "
"1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of "
"movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn "
"or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It "
"takes 7d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a "
"successful one. \n"
