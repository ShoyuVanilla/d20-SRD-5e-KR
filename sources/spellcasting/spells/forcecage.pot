"An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs "
"into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a "
"cage or a solid box, as you choose.    \n"
"A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made "
"from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart. A prison in the shape of "
"a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents "
"any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out "
"from the area.    \n"
"When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage's "
"area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too "
"large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area "
"until they are completely outside the area.    \n"
"A creature inside the cage can't leave it by nonmagical means. If the "
"creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, "
"it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can "
"use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can't exit the "
"cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into "
"the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.    \n"
"This spell can't be dispelled by **_dispel magic_**. \n"
