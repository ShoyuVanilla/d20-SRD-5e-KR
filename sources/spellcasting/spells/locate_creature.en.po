"Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the direction "
"to the creature's location, as long as that creature is within 1,000 feet of "
"you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement.    "
"\n"
"The spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest "
"creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn), so long as you "
"have seen such a creature up close--within 30 feet--at least once. If the "
"creature you described or named is in a different form, such as being under "
"the effects of a **_polymorph_** spell, this spell doesn't locate the "
"creature.    \n"
"This spell can't locate a creature if running water at least 10 feet wide "
"blocks a direct path between you and the creature. \n"
