"You transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything it's "
"wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The spell ends if "
"the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn't affected.    "
"\n"
"While in this form, the target's only method of movement is a flying speed "
"of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another "
"creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has "
"advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target "
"can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though "
"it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can't fall "
"and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise "
"incapacitated.    \n"
"While in the form of a misty cloud, the target can't talk or manipulate "
"objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can't be dropped, used, "
"or otherwise interacted with. The target can't attack or cast spells.\n"
