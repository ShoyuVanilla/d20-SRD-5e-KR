"A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an "
"unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature's "
"appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the "
"equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried "
"more than 10 feet away from the steed.    \n"
"For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The "
"creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of "
"100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast "
"pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 "
"minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if "
"the steed takes any damage.\n"
