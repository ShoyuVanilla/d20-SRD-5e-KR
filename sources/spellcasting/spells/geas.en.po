"You place a magical command on a creature that you can see within range, "
"forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course "
"of activity as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it must "
"succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the "
"duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage "
"each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no "
"more than once each day. A creature that can't understand you is unaffected "
"by the spell.    \n"
"You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result "
"in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends. You "
"can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A **_remove "
"curse_**, **_greater restoration_**, or **_wish_** spell also ends it. \n"
