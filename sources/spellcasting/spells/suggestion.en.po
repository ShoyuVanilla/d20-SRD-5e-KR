"You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and "
"magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and "
"understand you. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this "
"effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course "
"of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself "
"onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends "
"the spell.    \n"
"The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the "
"course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested "
"course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested "
"activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject "
"finishes what it was asked to do.    \n"
"You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during "
"the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse "
"to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn't met before the spell "
"expires, the activity isn't performed.    \n"
"If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends. \n"
