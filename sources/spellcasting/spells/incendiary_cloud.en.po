"A swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white- hot embers appears in a "
"20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads "
"around corners and is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a "
"wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses "
"it.    \n"
"When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving "
"throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much "
"damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when "
"it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn "
"there.    \n"
"The cloud moves 10 feet directly away from you in a direction that you "
"choose at the start of each of your turns. \n"
