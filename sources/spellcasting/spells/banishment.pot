"You attempt to send one creature that you can see within range to another "

"banished.    \n"
"If the target is native to the plane of existence you're on, you banish the "
"target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is "

"reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that "
"space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn't return. \n"
