"A churning storm cloud forms, centered on a point you can see and spreading "
"to a radius of 360 feet. Lightning flashes in the area, thunder booms, and "
"strong winds roar. Each creature under the cloud (no more than 5,000 feet "
"beneath the cloud) when it appears must make a Constitution saving throw. On "
"a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for "
"5 minutes.    \n"
"Each round you maintain concentration on this spell, the storm produces "
"additional effects on your turn.    \n"
"**Round 2.** Acidic rain falls from the cloud. Each creature and object "
"under the cloud takes 1d6 acid damage.    \n"
"**Round 3.** You call six bolts of lightning from the cloud to strike six "
"creatures or objects of your choice beneath the cloud. A given creature or "
"object can't be struck by more than one bolt. A struck creature must make a "
"Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed "
"save, or half as much damage on a successful one.    \n"
"**Round 4.** Hailstones rain down from the cloud. Each creature under the "
"cloud takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.    \n"
"**Round 5â€“10.** Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the cloud. The "
"area becomes difficult terrain and is heavily obscured. Each creature there "
"takes 1d6 cold damage. Ranged weapon attacks in the area are impossible. The "
"wind and rain count as a severe distraction for the purposes of maintaining "
"concentration on spells. Finally, gusts of strong wind (ranging from 20 to "
"50 miles per hour) automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar phenomena "
"in the area, whether mundane or magical.\n"
