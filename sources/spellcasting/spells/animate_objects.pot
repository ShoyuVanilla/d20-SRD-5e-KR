"Objects come to life at your command. Choose up to ten nonmagical objects "
"within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as two "
"objects, Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets count as eight "
"objects. You can't animate any object larger than Huge. Each target animates "
"and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until "
"reduced to 0 hit points.    \n"
"As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this "
"spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple "
"creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the "
"same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and "
"where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, "
"such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, "
"the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an "
"order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete. \n"

"An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, "
"and Dexterity determined by its size. Its Constitution is 10 and its "
"Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; "
"if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it "
"instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is "
"securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to "
"a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is "
"blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, "
"it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries "
"over to its original object form.    \n"
"If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack "
"against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an "
"attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The GM might "
"rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on "
"its form. \n"
