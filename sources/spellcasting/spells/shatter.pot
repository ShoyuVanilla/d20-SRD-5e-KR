"A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your "
"choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on "
"that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 "
"thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful "
"one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal "
"has disadvantage on this saving throw.    \n"
