"You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a "
"Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions "
"are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until "
"the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to "
"it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the "
"spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you."
