"Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see "
"within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in the area "
"into difficult terrain.    \n"
"When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or "
"starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw "
"or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be restrained by the tentacles until the "
"spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already "
"restrained by the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.    \n"
"A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength "
"or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it "
"frees itself.\n"
