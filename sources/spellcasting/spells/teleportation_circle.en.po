"As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground "
"inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation "
"circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same "
"plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you "
"drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that "
"enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle "
"or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.    \n"
"Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent "
"teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such "
"circle includes a unique sigil sequence--a string of magical runes arranged "
"in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, "
"you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, "
"determined by the GM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your "
"adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it "
"for 1 minute.    \n"
"You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the "
"same location every day for one year. You need not use the circle to "
"teleport when you cast the spell in this way.\n"
