"You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within "
"range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with the "
"chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and it "
"can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the "
"hand clings to the target.    \n"
"If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls "
"against you until the end of your next turn.    \n"
"This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th "
"level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8). \n"
