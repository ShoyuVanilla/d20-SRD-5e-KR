"version of the spell you choose, worth at least 500 gp per Hit Die of the "
"target)    \n"

"You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see within "
"range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be bound by the "
"spell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you cast it "
"again. While affected by this spell, the creature doesn't need to breathe, "
"eat, or drink, and it doesn't age. Divination spells can't locate or "
"perceive the target.    \n"
"When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of "
"imprisonment.    \n"
"**Burial.** The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of "
"magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can "
"pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel "
"to get into or out of it.    \n"
"The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.    "
"\n"
"**Chaining.** Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in "
"place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can't move or "
"be moved by any means until then.    \n"
"The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of "
"precious metal.    \n"
"**Hedged Prison.** The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane "
"that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be "
"a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of "
"your choice.    \n"
"The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature "
"representation of the prison made from jade.    \n"
"**Minimus Containment.** The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is "
"imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the "
"gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see "
"in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or "
"planar travel. The gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell remains "
"in effect.    \n"
"The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent "
"gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.    \n"
"**Slumber.** The target falls asleep and can't be awoken. The special "
"component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.    "
"\n"
"**Ending the Spell.** During the casting of the spell, in any of its "
"versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and "
"release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you "
"choose, but the GM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a "
"likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's "
"name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions "
"or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit "
"points.    \n"
"A **_dispel magic_** spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a "
"9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used "
"to create it.    \n"
"You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a "
"time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of "
"the first casting is immediately freed from its binding. \n"
