"You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target's movement is "
"unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can "
"neither reduce the target's speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or "
"restrained.    \n"
"The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from "
"nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it "
"grappled. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target's "
"movement or attacks.\n"
