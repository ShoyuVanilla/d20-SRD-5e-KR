"You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you "
"choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk, lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous "
"snake, fish (quipper), rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel. Appearing "
"in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the "
"chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead "
"of a beast.    \n"
"Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your "
"commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A "
"familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.    \n"
"When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no "
"physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again.    \n"
"While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it "
"telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your "
"familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, "
"gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During "
"this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.    \n"
"As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into "
"a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can "
"dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can "
"cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.    \n"
"You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell "
"while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new "
"form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms "
"into the chosen creature.    \n"
"Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can "
"deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within "
"100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you "
"cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier "
"for the roll.\n"
