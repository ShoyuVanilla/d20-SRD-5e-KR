"You summon a fey creature of challenge rating 6 or lower, or a fey spirit "
"that takes the form of a beast of challenge rating 6 or lower. It appears in "
"an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The fey creature "
"disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.    \n"
"The fey creature is friendly to you and your companions for the "
"duration. Roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turns. It "
"obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you), "
"as long as they don't violate its alignment. If you don't issue any commands "
"to the fey creature, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise "
"takes no actions.    \n"
"If your concentration is broken, the fey creature doesn't "
"disappear. Instead, you lose control of the fey creature, it becomes hostile "
"toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled fey "
"creature can't be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you "
"summoned it.    \n"
"The GM has the fey creature's statistics. \n"
