"A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your "
"companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within "
"30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks "
"and can't be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this "
"bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage."
