"Eight multicolored rays of light flash from your hand. Each ray is a "
"different color and has a different power and purpose. Each creature in a "
"60-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 "
"to determine which color ray affects it.    \n"
"**1. Red.** The target takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as "
"much damage on a successful one.    \n"
"**2. Orange.** The target takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half "
"as much damage on a successful one.    \n"
"**3. Yellow.** The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or "
"half as much damage on a successful one.    \n"
"**4. Green.** The target takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half "
"as much damage on a successful one.    \n"
"**5. Blue.** The target takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as "
"much damage on a successful one.    \n"
"**6. Indigo.** On a failed save, the target is restrained. It must then make "
"a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it "
"successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three "
"times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified "
"condition. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep "
"track of both until the target collects three of a kind.    \n"
"**7. Violet.** On a failed save, the target is blinded. It must then make a "
"Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends "
"the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another "
"plane of existence of the GM's choosing and is no longer "
"blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane "
"is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or "
"Ethereal planes.)    \n"
"**8. Special.** The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice more, rerolling "
"any 8. \n"
