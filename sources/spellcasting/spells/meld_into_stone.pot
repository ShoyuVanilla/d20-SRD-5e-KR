"You step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your "
"body, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the stone for "
"the duration. Using your movement, you step into the stone at a point you "
"can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable "
"by nonmagical senses.    \n"
"While merged with the stone, you can't see what occurs outside it, and any "
"Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with "
"disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on "
"yourself while merged in the stone. You can use your movement to leave the "
"stone where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can't move.    "
"\n"
"Minor physical damage to the stone doesn't harm you, but its partial "
"destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit "
"within it) expels you and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you. The stone's "
"complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels "
"you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage to you. If expelled, you fall prone in "
"an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered. \n"
