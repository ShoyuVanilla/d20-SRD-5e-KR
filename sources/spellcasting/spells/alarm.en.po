"You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an "
"area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell "
"ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or "
"enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures "
"that won't set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or "
"audible.    \n"
"A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile "
"of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.    \n"
"An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 "
"feet. \n"
