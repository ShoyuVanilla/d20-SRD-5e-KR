"A Large spectral guardian appears and hovers for the duration in an "
"unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The guardian "
"occupies that space and is indistinct except for a gleaming sword and shield "
"emblazoned with the symbol of your deity.    \n"
"Any creature hostile to you that moves to a space within 10 feet of the "
"guardian for the first time on a turn must succeed on a Dexterity saving "
"throw. The creature takes 20 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as "
"much damage on a successful one. The guardian vanishes when it has dealt a "
"total of 60 damage.\n"
