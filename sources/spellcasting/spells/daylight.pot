"A 60-foot-radius sphere of light spreads out from a point you choose within "
"range. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an additional 60 "
"feet.    \n"
"If you chose a point on an object you are holding or one that isn't being "
"worn or carried, the light shines from the object and moves with "
"it. Completely covering the affected object with an opaque object, such as a "
"bowl or a helm, blocks the light.    \n"
"If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a "
"spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is "
"dispelled. \n"
