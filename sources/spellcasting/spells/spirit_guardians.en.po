"You call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you to a distance of "
"15 feet for the duration. If you are good or neutral, their spectral form "

"fiendish.    \n"

"see to be unaffected by it. An affected creature's speed is halved in the "
"area, and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or "
"starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, "
"the creature takes 3d8 radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 "
"necrotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes "
"half as much damage. \n"
