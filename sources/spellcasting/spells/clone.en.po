"This spell grows an inert duplicate of a living creature as a safeguard "
"against death. This clone forms inside a sealed vessel and grows to full "
"size and maturity after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone be a "
"younger version of the same creature. It remains inert and endures "
"indefinitely, as long as its vessel remains undisturbed.    \n"
"At any time after the clone matures, if the original creature dies, its soul "
"transfers to the clone, provided that the soul is free and willing to "
"return. The clone is physically identical to the original and has the same "
"personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the original's "
"equipment. The original creature's physical remains, if they still exist, "
"become inert and can't thereafter be restored to life, since the creature's "
"soul is elsewhere. \n"
