"This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter "
"and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space "
"of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the "
"duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the "
"spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.    \n"
"The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more "
"than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 "
"feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes "
"and the like, but it can't cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For "
"example, the disk can't move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave "
"such a pit if it was created at the bottom.    \n"
"If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can't "
"move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends. \n"
