"You hide a chest, and all its contents, on the Ethereal Plane. You must "
"touch the chest and the miniature replica that serves as a material "
"component for the spell. The chest can contain up to 12 cubic feet of "
"nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet).    \n"
"While the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can use an action and "
"touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space on "
"the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the chest back to the Ethereal "
"Plane by using an action and touching both the chest and the replica.    \n"
"After 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance per day that the "
"spell's effect ends. This effect ends if you cast this spell again, if the "
"smaller replica chest is destroyed, or if you choose to end the spell as an "
"action. If the spell ends and the larger chest is on the Ethereal Plane, it "
"is irretrievably lost. \n"
