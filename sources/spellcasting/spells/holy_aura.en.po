"Divine light washes out from you and coalesces in a soft radiance in a "
"30-foot radius around you. Creatures of your choice in that radius when you "
"cast this spell shed dim light in a 5-foot radius and have advantage on all "
"saving throws, and other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against "
"them until the spell ends. In addition, when a fiend or an undead hits an "
"affected creature with a melee attack, the aura flashes with brilliant "
"light. The attacker must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be "
"blinded until the spell ends."
