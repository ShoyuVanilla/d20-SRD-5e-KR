"You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead "
"no longer than 10 days. If the creature's soul is both willing and at "
"liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.    "
"\n"
"This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that "
"affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn't, however, "
"remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren't first "
"removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature "
"returns to life. The spell can't return an undead creature to life.    \n"
"This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn't restore missing body "
"parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its "
"survival--its head, for instance--the spell automatically fails.    \n"
"Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a âˆ’4 penalty to all "
"attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target "
"finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears. \n"
