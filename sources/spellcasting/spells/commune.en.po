"You contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions that "
"can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your questions before the "
"spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.    \n"
"Divine beings aren't necessarily omniscient, so you might receive "
"\"unclear\" as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies "
"beyond the deity's knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be "
"misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, the GM might offer a short "
"phrase as an answer instead.    \n"
"If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long "
"rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the "
"first that you get no answer. The GM makes this roll in secret. \n"
