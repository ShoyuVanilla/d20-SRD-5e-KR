"This spell allows you to find the shortest, most direct physical route to a "
"specific fixed location that you are familiar with on the same plane of "
"existence. If you name a destination on another plane of existence, a "
"destination that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a destination that "
"isn't specific (such as \"a green dragon's lair\"), the spell fails.    \n"
"For the duration, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as the "
"destination, you know how far it is and in what direction it lies. While you "
"are traveling there, whenever you are presented with a choice of paths along "
"the way, you automatically determine which path is the shortest and most "
"direct route (but not necessarily the safest route) to the destination. \n"
