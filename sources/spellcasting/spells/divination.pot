"Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god's "
"servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or "
"activity to occur within 7 days. The GM offers a truthful reply. The reply "
"might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.    \n"
"The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might "
"change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or "
"gain of a companion.    \n"
"If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long "
"rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the "
"first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret. \n"
