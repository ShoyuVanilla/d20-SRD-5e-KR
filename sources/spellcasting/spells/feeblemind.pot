"You blast the mind of a creature that you can see within range, attempting "
"to shatter its intellect and personality. The target takes 4d6 psychic "
"damage and must make an Intelligence saving throw.    \n"
"On a failed save, the creature's Intelligence and Charisma scores become "
"1. The creature can't cast spells, activate magic items, understand "
"language, or communicate in any intelligible way. The creature can, however, "
"identify its friends, follow them, and even protect them.    \n"
"At the end of every 30 days, the creature can repeat its saving throw "
"against this spell. If it succeeds on its saving throw, the spell ends.    "
"\n"
"The spell can also be ended by **_greater restoration_**, **_heal_**, or "
"**_wish_**. \n"
