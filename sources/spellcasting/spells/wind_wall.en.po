"A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within "
"range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot "
"thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one "
"continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration.    \n"
"When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength "
"saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or "
"half as much damage on a successful one.    \n"
"The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller "
"flying creatures or objects can't pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight "
"materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other "
"ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected "
"upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, "
"and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can't "
"pass through it. \n"
