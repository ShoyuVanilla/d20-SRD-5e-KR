"Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a "
"15-foot-radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around "
"corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and "
"nonmagical light can't illuminate it.    \n"
"If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn't "
"being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with "
"it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, "
"such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.    \n"
"If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of light created by a "
"spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is "
"dispelled. \n"
