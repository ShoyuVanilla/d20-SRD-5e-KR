"Choose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a door, a "
"box, a chest, a set of manacles, a padlock, or another object that contains "
"a mundane or magical means that prevents access.    \n"
"A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred "
"becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, "
"only one of them is unlocked.    \n"
"If you choose a target that is held shut with **_arcane lock_**, that spell "
"is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and "
"shut normally.    \n"
"When you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as far away as 300 feet, "
"emanates from the target object.\n"
