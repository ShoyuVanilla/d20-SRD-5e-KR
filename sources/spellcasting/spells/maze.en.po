"You banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine "
"demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the "
"maze.    \n"
"The target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it "
"makes a DC 20 Intelligence check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell "
"ends (a minotaur or goristro demon automatically succeeds).    \n"
"When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that "
"space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space. \n"
