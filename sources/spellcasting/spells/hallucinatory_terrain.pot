"You make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell "
"like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be "
"made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or "
"impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a "
"precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth "
"road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area "
"aren't changed in appearance.    \n"
"The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures "
"entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference "
"isn't obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can "
"attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to "
"disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it "
"as a vague image superimposed on the terrain. \n"
