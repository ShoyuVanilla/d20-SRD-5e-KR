"You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible "
"phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a "
"spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it "
"isn't accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.    \n"
"You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within "
"range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that "
"its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an "
"image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears "
"to be walking.    \n"
"Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because "
"things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the "
"image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence "
"(Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the "
"illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image. \n"
