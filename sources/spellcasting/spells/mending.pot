"This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a "
"broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking "
"wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any "
"dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.    \n"
"This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell "
"can't restore magic to such an object. \n"
