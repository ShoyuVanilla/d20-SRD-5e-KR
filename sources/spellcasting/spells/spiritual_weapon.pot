"You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the "
"duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you "
"can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the "
"weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your "
"spellcasting ability modifier.    \n"
"As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and "
"repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.    \n"
"The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are "
"associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace "
"and Thor for his hammer) make this spell's effect resemble that weapon. \n"
