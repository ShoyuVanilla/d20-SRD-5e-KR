"You create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000 square "
"feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For the "
"duration, creatures can't teleport into the area or use portals, such as "
"those created by the **_gate_** spell, to enter the area. The spell proofs "
"the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from "
"accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, Feywild, "
"Shadowfell, or the **_plane shift_** spell.    \n"
"In addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when you "
"cast it. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, "
"fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters the spell's area for the "
"first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 "
"radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this spell).    \n"
"When you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that "
"speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the spell.    "
"\n"
"The spell's area can't overlap with the area of another **_forbiddance_** "
"spell. If you cast **_forbiddance_** every day for 30 days in the same "
"location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the material components "
"are consumed on the last casting. \n"
