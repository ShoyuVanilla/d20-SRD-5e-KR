"This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are "
"two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term "
"benefits.    \n"
"If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All "
"normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and "
"overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement "
"for every 1 foot it moves.    \n"
"You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from "
"being affected.    \n"
"If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a "
"half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 "
"year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested. \n"
