"With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a "
"fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire "
"casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the "
"center of an inverted magic circle in order to keep it trapped while this "
"spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must make a "
"Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the "
"duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that "
"spell's duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.    \n"
"A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its "
"ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to "
"guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of "
"your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to "
"twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out "
"your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to "
"report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a "
"different plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and "
"remains there until the spell ends. \n"

"year and a day with a 9th-level spell slot. \n"
