"You create a shadowy door on a flat solid surface that you can see within "
"range. The door is large enough to allow Medium creatures to pass through "
"unhindered. When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that appears to be an "
"empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or stone. When the spell "
"ends, the door disappears, and any creatures or objects inside the demiplane "
"remain trapped there, as the door also disappears from the other side.    \n"
"Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane, or have the "
"shadowy door connect to a demiplane you created with a previous casting of "
"this spell. Additionally, if you know the nature and contents of a demiplane "
"created by a casting of this spell by another creature, you can have the "
"shadowy door connect to its demiplane instead. \n"
