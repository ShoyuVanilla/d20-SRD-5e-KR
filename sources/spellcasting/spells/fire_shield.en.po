"Thin and wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding bright "
"light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can "
"end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.    \n"
"The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you "
"choose. The warm shield grants you resistance to cold damage, and the chill "
"shield grants you resistance to fire damage.    \n"
"In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee "
"attack, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes 2d8 fire damage "
"from a warm shield, or 2d8 cold damage from a cold shield. \n"
