"You create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades made of magical "
"energy. The wall appears within range and lasts for the duration. You can "
"make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or "
"a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The "
"wall provides three-quarters cover to creatures behind it, and its space is "
"difficult terrain.    \n"
"When a creature enters the wall's area for the first time on a turn or "
"starts its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a "
"failed save, the creature takes 6d10 slashing damage. On a successful save, "
"the creature takes half as much damage. \n"
