"Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell "
"ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position "
"so it's impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to "
"dismiss the illusory duplicates.    \n"
"Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell's duration, "
"roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your "
"duplicates.    \n"
"If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the "
"attack's target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or "
"higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.    \n"
"A duplicate's AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a "
"duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by "
"an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell "
"ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.    \n"
"A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can't see, if it relies on "
"senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions "
"as false, as with truesight. \n"
