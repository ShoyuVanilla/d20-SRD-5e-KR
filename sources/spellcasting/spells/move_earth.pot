"Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You "
"can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the "
"duration. You can raise or lower the area's elevation, create or fill in a "
"trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such "
"changes can't exceed half the area's largest dimension. So, if you affect a "
"40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower "
"the square's elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, "
"and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.    \n"
"At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can "
"choose a new area of terrain to affect.    \n"
"Because the terrain's transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area "
"can't usually be trapped or injured by the ground's movement.    \n"
"This spell can't manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and "
"structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the "
"terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.    \n"
"Similarly, this spell doesn't directly affect plant growth. The moved earth "
"carries any plants along with it.\n"
