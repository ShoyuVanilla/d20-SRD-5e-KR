"You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or "
"smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is "
"neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a "
"Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.    \n"
"If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes "
"size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal "
"size at once.    \n"
"**Enlarge.** The target's size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is "
"multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category-- from "
"Medium to Large, for example. If there isn't enough room for the target to "
"double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in "
"the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on "
"Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's weapons also grow "
"to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target's "
"attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage.    \n"
"**Reduce.** The target's size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is "
"reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one "
"category--from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the "
"target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving "
"throws. The target's weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these "
"weapons are reduced, the target's attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage "
"(this can't reduce the damage below 1). \n"
