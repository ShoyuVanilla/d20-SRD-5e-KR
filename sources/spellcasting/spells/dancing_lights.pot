"You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as "
"torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the "
"duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely "
"humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds "
"dim light in a 10- foot radius.    \n"
"As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a "
"new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light "
"created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell's "
"range.\n"
