"You attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into "
"stone. If the target's body is made of flesh, the creature must make a "
"Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained as its flesh "
"begins to harden. On a successful save, the creature isn't affected.    \n"
"A creature restrained by this spell must make another Constitution saving "
"throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this "
"spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is "
"turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition for the "
"duration. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep "
"track of both until the target collects three of a kind.    \n"
"If the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from "
"similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.    \n"
"If you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible "
"duration, the creature is turned to stone until the effect is removed. \n"
