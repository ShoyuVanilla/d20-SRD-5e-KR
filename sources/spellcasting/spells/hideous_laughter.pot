"A creature of your choice that you can see within range perceives everything "
"as hilariously funny and falls into fits of laughter if this spell affects "
"it. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall prone, becoming "
"incapacitated and unable to stand up for the duration. A creature with an "
"Intelligence score of 4 or less isn't affected.    \n"
"At the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage, the target "
"can make another Wisdom saving throw. The target has advantage on the saving "
"throw if it's triggered by damage. On a success, the spell ends. \n"
