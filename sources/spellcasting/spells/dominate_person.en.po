"You attempt to beguile a humanoid that you can see within range. It must "
"succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If "
"you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage "
"on the saving throw.    \n"
"While the target is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as "
"the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this "
"telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious "
"(no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a "
"simple and general course of action, such as \"Attack that creature,\" \"Run "
"over there,\" or \"Fetch that object.\" If the creature completes the order "
"and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves "
"itself to the best of its ability.    \n"
"You can use your action to take total and precise control of the "
"target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions "
"you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During "
"this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this "
"requires you to use your own reaction as well.    \n"
"Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw "
"against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends. \n"
