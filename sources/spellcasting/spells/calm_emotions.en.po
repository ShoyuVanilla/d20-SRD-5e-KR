"You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each humanoid "
"in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must "
"make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving "
"throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the "
"following two effects.    \n"
"You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or "
"frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided "
"that its duration has not expired in the meantime.   \n"
"Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your "
"choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is "
"attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being "
"harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the "
"GM rules otherwise. \n"
