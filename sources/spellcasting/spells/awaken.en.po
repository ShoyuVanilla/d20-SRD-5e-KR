"After spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious "
"gemstone, you touch a Huge or smaller beast or plant. The target must have "
"either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or less. The target "
"gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the ability to speak one "
"language you know. If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move "
"its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar "
"to a human's. Your GM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, "
"such as the statistics for the awakened shrub or the awakened tree.   \n"
"The awakened beast or plant is charmed by you for 30 days or until you or "
"your companions do anything harmful to it. When the charmed condition ends, "
"the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on "
"how you treated it while it was charmed.\n"
