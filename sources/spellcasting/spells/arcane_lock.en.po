"You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it "
"becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when "
"you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a "
"password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this "
"spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the "
"spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting **_knock_** on the object "
"suppresses **_arcane lock_** for 10 minutes.    \n"
"While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force "
"open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10. \n"
