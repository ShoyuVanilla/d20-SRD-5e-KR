"One creature or object of your choice that you can see within range rises "
"vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The "
"spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling "
"creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.    \n"
"The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or "
"surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move "
"as if it were climbing. You can change the target's altitude by up to 20 "
"feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move "
"up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move "
"the target, which must remain within the spell's range.    \n"
"When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still "
"aloft. \n"
