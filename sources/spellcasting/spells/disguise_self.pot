"You make yourself--including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other "
"belongings on your person--look different until the spell ends or until you "
"use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can "
"appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you "
"must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, "
"the extent of the illusion is up to you.    \n"
"The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical "
"inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, "
"objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing "
"or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner "
"than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump "
"into you while it was seemingly still in midair.    \n"
"To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect "
"your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check "
"against your spell save DC. \n"
