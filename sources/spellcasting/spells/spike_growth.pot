"The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and "
"sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the "
"duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 "
"piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.   \n"
"The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any "
"creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a "
"Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the "
"terrain as hazardous before entering it. \n"
