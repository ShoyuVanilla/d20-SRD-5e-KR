"Your touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack against a creature "
"within your reach. On a hit, you afflict the creature with a disease of your "
"choice from any of the ones described below.    \n"
"At the end of each of the target's turns, it must make a Constitution saving "
"throw. After failing three of these saving throws, the disease's effects "
"last for the duration, and the creature stops making these saves. After "
"succeeding on three of these saving throws, the creature recovers from the "
"disease, and the spell ends.    \n"
"Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that "
"removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease's effects apply to it.    "
"\n"
"**Blinding Sickness.** Pain grips the creature's mind, and its eyes turn "
"milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom "
"saving throws and is blinded.    \n"
"**Filth Fever.** A raging fever sweeps through the creature's body. The "
"creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and "
"attack rolls that use Strength.    \n"
"**Flesh Rot.** The creature's flesh decays. The creature has disadvantage on "
"Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.    \n"
"**Mindfire.** The creature's mind becomes feverish. The creature has "
"disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and the "
"creature behaves as if under the effects of the **_confusion_** spell during "
"combat.    \n"
"**Seizure.** The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has "
"disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls "
"that use Dexterity.    \n"
"**Slimy Doom.** The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The creature "
"has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In "
