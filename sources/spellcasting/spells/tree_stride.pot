"You gain the ability to enter a tree and move from inside it to inside "
"another tree of the same kind within 500 feet. Both trees must be living and "
"at least the same size as you. You must use 5 feet of movement to enter a "
"tree. You instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind "
"within 500 feet and, as part of the move used to enter the tree, can either "
"pass into one of those trees or step out of the tree you're in. You appear "
"in a spot of your choice within 5 feet of the destination tree, using "
"another 5 feet of movement. If you have no movement left, you appear within "
"5 feet of the tree you entered.    \n"
"You can use this transportation ability once per round for the duration. You "
"must end each turn outside a tree. \n"
