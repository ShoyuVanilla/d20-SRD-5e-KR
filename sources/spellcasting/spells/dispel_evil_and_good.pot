"Shimmering energy surrounds and protects you from fey, undead, and creatures "
"originating from beyond the Material Plane. For the duration, celestials, "
"elementals, fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on attack rolls "
"against you.    \n"
"You can end the spell early by using either of the following special "
"functions.    \n"
"**Break Enchantment.** As your action, you touch a creature you can reach "
"that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by a celestial, an elemental, a "
"fey, a fiend, or an undead. The creature you touch is no longer charmed, "
"frightened, or possessed by such creatures.    \n"
"**Dismissal.** As your action, make a melee spell attack against a "
"celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead you can reach. On a "
"hit, you attempt to drive the creature back to its home plane. The creature "
"must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent back to its home plane "
"(if it isn't there already). If they aren't on their home plane, undead are "
"sent to the Shadowfell, and fey are sent to the Feywild. \n"
