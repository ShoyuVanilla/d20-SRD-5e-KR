"You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and "
"magically influence up to twelve creatures of your choice that you can see "
"within range and that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be "
"charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a "
"manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature "
"to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other "
"obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.    \n"
"Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues "
"the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested "
"course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested "
"activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject "
"finishes what it was asked to do.    \n"
"You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during "
"the duration. For example, you might suggest that a group of soldiers give "
"all their money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn't met "
"before the spell ends, the activity isn't performed.    \n"
"If you or any of your companions damage a creature affected by this spell, "
"the spell ends for that creature. \n"
