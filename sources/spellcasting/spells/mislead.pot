"You become invisible at the same time that an illusory double of you appears "
"where you are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but the "
"invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell.    \n"
"You can use your action to move your illusory double up to twice your speed "
"and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose.    \n"
"You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were "
"located where it is. On each of your turns as a bonus action, you can switch "
"from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using "
"its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own "
"surroundings. \n"
