"This spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic "
"connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target "
"is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and "
"it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take "
"the same amount of damage.    \n"
"The spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target become "
"separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on "
"either of the connected creatures. You can also dismiss the spell as an "
"action. \n"
