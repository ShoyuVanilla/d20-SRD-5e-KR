"You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a "
"message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in "
"a whisper that only you can hear.    \n"
"You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the "
"target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, "
"1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the "
"spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel "
"freely around corners or through openings. \n"
