"You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse of your choice "
"within range, allowing it to answer the questions you pose. The corpse must "
"still have a mouth and can't be undead. The spell fails if the corpse was "
"the target of this spell within the last 10 days.    \n"
"Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The "
"corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it "
"knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is "
"under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or "
"it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn't return the creature's soul "
"to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can't learn new "
"information, doesn't comprehend anything that has happened since it died, "
"and can't speculate about future events.\n"
