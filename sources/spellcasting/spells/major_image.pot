"You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible "
"phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a "
"spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems "
"completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to "
"the thing depicted. You can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause "
"damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or "
"a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte's stench).    \n"
"As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to "
"cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes "
"location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural "
"for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move "
"it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you "
"can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even "
"making it carry on a conversation, for example.    \n"
"Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because "
"things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the "
"image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence "
"(Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the "
"illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its "
"other sensory qualities become faint to the creature. \n"
