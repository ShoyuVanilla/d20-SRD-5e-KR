"A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of "
"your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius sphere. Each "
"creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed "
"save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half "
"as much damage.    \n"
"If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water "
"(not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 "
"inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures "
"that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A "
"trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your "
"spell save DC to break free.    \n"
"You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you "
"wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, "
"appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to "
"can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the "
"sling's normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the "
"normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without "
"shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn't already shattered, it "
"explodes. \n"
