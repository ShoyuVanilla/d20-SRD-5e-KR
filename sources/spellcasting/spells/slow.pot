"You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot cube "
"within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be "
"affected by this spell for the duration.    \n"
"An affected target's speed is halved, it takes a âˆ’2 penalty to AC and "
"Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions. On its turn, it can use "
"either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature's "
"abilities or magic items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack "
"during its turn.    \n"
"If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, "
"roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn't take effect until the "
"creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to "
"complete the spell. If it can't, the spell is wasted.    \n"
"A creature affected by this spell makes another Wisdom saving throw at the "
"end of its turn. On a successful save, the effect ends for it. \n"
