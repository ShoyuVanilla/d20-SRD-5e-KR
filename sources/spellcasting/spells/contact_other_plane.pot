"You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long- dead sage, or some "
"other mysterious entity from another plane. Contacting this extraplanar "
"intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell, "
"make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic "
"damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can't "
"take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and "
"speak only in gibberish. A **_greater restoration_** spell cast on you ends "
"this effect.    \n"
"On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You must "
"ask your questions before the spell ends. The GM answers each question with "
"one word, such as \"yes,\" \"no,\" \"maybe,\" \"never,\" \"irrelevant,\" or "
"\"unclear\" (if the entity doesn't know the answer to the question). If a "
"one-word answer would be misleading, the GM might instead offer a short "
"phrase as an answer. \n"
