"You step into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, in the area where it "
"overlaps with your current plane. You remain in the Border Ethereal for the "
"duration or until you use your action to dismiss the spell. During this "
"time, you can move in any direction. If you move up or down, every foot of "
"movement costs an extra foot. You can see and hear the plane you originated "
"from, but everything there looks gray, and you can't see anything more than "
"60 feet away.    \n"
"While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other "
"creatures on that plane. Creatures that aren't on the Ethereal Plane can't "
"perceive you and can't interact with you, unless a special ability or magic "
"has given them the ability to do so.    \n"
"You ignore all objects and effects that aren't on the Ethereal Plane, "
"allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the plane you "
"originated from.    \n"
"When the spell ends, you immediately return to the plane you originated from "
"in the spot you currently occupy. If you occupy the same spot as a solid "
"object or creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted to the "
"nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to "
"twice the number of feet you are moved.    \n"
"This spell has no effect if you cast it while you are on the Ethereal Plane "
"or a plane that doesn't border it, such as one of the Outer Planes. \n"

"**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th "
"level or higher, you can target up to three willing creatures (including "
"you) for each slot level above 7th. The creatures must be within 10 feet of "
"you when you cast the spell. \n"
