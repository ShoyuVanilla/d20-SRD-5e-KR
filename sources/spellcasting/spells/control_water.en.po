"Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you "
"choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of "
"the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, "
"you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.    \n"
"**Flood.** You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to "
"rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water "
"spills over onto dry land.    \n"
"If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot "
"tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then "
"crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried "
"with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave "
"have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.    \n"
"The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a "
"different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the "
"start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.    \n"
"**Part Water.** You cause water in the area to move apart and create a "
"trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water "
"forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you "
"choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over "
"the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.    \n"
"**Redirect Flow.** You cause flowing water in the area to move in a "
"direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up "
"walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you "
"direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow "
"based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the "
"direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.    "
"\n"
"**Whirlpool.** This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square "
"and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the "
"area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 "
"feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water "
"and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can "
"swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against "
"your spell save DC.    \n"
"When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its "
"turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the "
"creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the "
"spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't "
"caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to "
"try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on "
"the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.    \n"
"The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes "
"2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the "
"vortex. \n"
