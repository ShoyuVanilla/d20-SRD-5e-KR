"You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see "
"within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in "
"a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and "
"structures in contact with the ground in that area.    \n"
"The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the "
"ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a "
"failed save, the creature's concentration is broken.    \n"
"When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating "
"on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving "
"throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.    \n"
"This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, "
"as determined by the GM.    \n"
"**Fissures.** Fissures open throughout the spell's area at the start of your "
"next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in "
"locations chosen by the GM. Each is 1d10 Ã— 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and "
"extends from one edge of the spell's area to the opposite side. A creature "
"standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving "
"throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the "
"fissure's edge as it opens.    \n"
"A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse "
"(see below).    \n"
"**Structures.** The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in "
"contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start "
"of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit "
"points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature "
"within half the distance of a structure's height must make a Dexterity "
"saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, "
"is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength "
"(Athletics) check as an action to escape. The GM can adjust the DC higher or "
"lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the "
"creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone or become "
"buried. \n"
