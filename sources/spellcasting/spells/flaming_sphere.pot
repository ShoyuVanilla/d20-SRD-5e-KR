"A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your "
"choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its "
"turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The "
"creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a "
"successful one.    \n"
"As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the "
"sphere into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the "
"sphere's damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn.    \n"
"When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall "
"and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable "
"objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot "
"radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. \n"
