"You choose a creature you can see within range and mystically mark it as "
"your quarry. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra 1d6 damage to the "
"target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack, and you have advantage on "
"any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check you make to find it. If "
"the target drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you can use a bonus "
"action on a subsequent turn of yours to mark a new creature.  **At Higher "
"Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd or 4th level, "
"you can maintain your concentration on the spell for up to 8 hours. When you "
"use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can maintain your concentration "
"on the spell for up to 24 hours."
