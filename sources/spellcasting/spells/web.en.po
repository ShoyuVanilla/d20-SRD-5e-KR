"You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within "
"range. The webs fill a 20- foot cube from that point for the duration. The "
"webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.    \n"
"If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or "
"trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web "
"collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs "
"layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.    \n"
"Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during "
"its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature "
"is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.    "
"\n"
"A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength "
"check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer "
"restrained.    \n"
"The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away "
"in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in "
"the fire. \n"
