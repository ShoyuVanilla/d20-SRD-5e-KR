"Describe or name an object that is familiar to you. You sense the direction "
"to the object's location, as long as that object is within 1,000 feet of "
"you. If the object is in motion, you know the direction of its movement.    "
"\n"
"The spell can locate a specific object known to you, as long as you have "
"seen it up close--within 30 feet--at least once. Alternatively, the spell "
"can locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind "
"of apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon.    \n"
"This spell can't locate an object if any thickness of lead, even a thin "
"sheet, blocks a direct path between you and the object. \n"
