"You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no "
"more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your "
"purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, "
"or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is "
"less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to "
"seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a "
"latch, but finer mechanical detail isn't possible."
