"You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible "
"phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The "
"illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot "
"cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and "
"what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.    "
"\n"
"When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence "
"and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes "
"performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this "
"time, the illusion can be activated again.    \n"
"The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, "
"though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 "
"feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to "
"appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could "
"set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or "
"phrase.    \n"
"Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because "
"things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the "
"image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence "
"(Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the "
"illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any "
"noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature. \n"
