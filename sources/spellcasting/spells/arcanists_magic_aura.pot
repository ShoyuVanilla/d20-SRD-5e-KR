"You place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that "
"divination spells reveal false information about it. The target can be a "
"willing creature or an object that isn't being carried or worn by another "
"creature.    \n"
"When you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following effects. The "
"effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature "
"or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, "
"the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.    \n"
"**False Aura.** You change the way the target appears to spells and magical "
"effects, such as **_detect magic_**, that detect magical auras. You can make "
"a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or "
"change the object's magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific "
"school of magic that you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you "
"can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.    "
"\n"
"**Mask.** You change the way the target appears to spells and magical "
"effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin's Divine Sense or the "
"trigger of a **_symbol_** spell. You choose a creature type and other spells "
"and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of that type "
"or of that alignment. \n"
