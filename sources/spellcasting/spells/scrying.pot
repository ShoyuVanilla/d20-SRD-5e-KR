"You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same "
"plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which "
"is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical "
"connection you have to it. If a target knows you're casting this spell, it "
"can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed."

"On a successful save, the target isn't affected, and you can't use this "
"spell against it again for 24 hours.    \n"
"On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of "
"the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were "
"there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for "
"the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a "
"luminous orb about the size of your fist.    \n"
"Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen "
"before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that "
"location and doesn't move. \n"
