"You imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and animation, "
"giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple "
"commands. You can question plants about events in the spell's area within "
"the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, "
"and other circumstances.    \n"
"You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets "
"and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you "
"can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain "
"that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, "
"for example.    \n"
"Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the GM's "
"discretion. The spell doesn't enable plants to uproot themselves and move "
"about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.    \n"
"If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you "
"shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.    "
"\n"
"This spell can cause the plants created by the **_entangle_** spell to "
"release a restrained creature. \n"
