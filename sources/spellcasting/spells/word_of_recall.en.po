"You and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly teleport "
"to a previously designated sanctuary. You and any creatures that teleport "
"with you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated "
"when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you cast this spell without "
"first preparing a sanctuary, the spell has no effect.    \n"
"You must designate a sanctuary by casting this spell within a location, such "
"as a temple, dedicated to or strongly linked to your deity. If you attempt "
"to cast the spell in this manner in an area that isn't dedicated to your "
"deity, the spell has no effect.\n"
