"Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you "
"choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a Constitution "
"saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 radiant damage and is "
"blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and "
"isn't blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this "
"saving throw.    \n"
"A creature blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at "
"the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer "
"blinded.    \n"
"This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell. \n"
