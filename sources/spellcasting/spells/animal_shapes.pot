"Your magic turns others into beasts. Choose any number of willing creatures "
"that you can see within range. You transform each target into the form of a "
"Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or lower. On subsequent "
"turns, you can use your action to transform affected creatures into new "
"forms.    \n"
"The transformation lasts for the duration for each target, or until the "
"target drops to 0 hit points or dies. You can choose a different form for "
"each target. A target's game statistics are replaced by the statistics of "
"the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment and Intelligence, "
"Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target assumes the hit points of its new "
"form, and when it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of "
"hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of "
"dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal "
"form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form "
"to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in "
"the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak "
"or cast spells.    \n"
"The target's gear melds into the new form. The target can't activate, wield, "
"or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment. \n"
