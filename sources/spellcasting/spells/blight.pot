"Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see "
"within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a "
"Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed "
"save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect "
"on undead or constructs.    \n"
"If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw "
"with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.    \n"
"If you target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or "
"shrub, it doesn't make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies. \n"
