"This spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures "
"that you can see within range. You give each target you choose a new, "
"illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, "
"and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.    \n"
"The spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, "
"and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and "
"appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change a target's body type, so "
"you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of "
"limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts "
"for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.    \n"
"The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical "
"inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature's "
"outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel "
"nothing or would feel the creature's head and hair. If you use this spell to "
"appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch "
"you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.    \n"
"A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence "
"(Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes "
"aware that the target is disguised. \n"
