"You create an invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a "
"place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is "
"unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of "
"trees). The sensor remains in place for the duration, and it can't be "
"attacked or otherwise interacted with.    \n"
"When you cast the spell, you choose seeing or hearing. You can use the "
"chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. As your action, "
"you can switch between seeing and hearing.    \n"
"A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from "
"**_see invisibility_** or truesight) sees a luminous, intangible orb about "
"the size of your fist. \n"
