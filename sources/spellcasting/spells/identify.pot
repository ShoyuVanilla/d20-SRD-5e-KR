"You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the "
"spell. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn "
"its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, "
"and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are "
"affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, "
"you learn which spell created it.    \n"
"If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what "
"spells, if any, are currently affecting it. \n"
