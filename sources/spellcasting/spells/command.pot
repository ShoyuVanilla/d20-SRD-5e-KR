"You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The "
"target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its "
"next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn't "
"understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.    "
"\n"
"Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command "
"other than one described here. If you do so, the GM determines how the "
"target behaves. If the target can't follow your command, the spell ends.    "
"\n"
"**Approach.** The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct "
"route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.    \n"
"**Drop.** The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.    "
"\n"
"**Flee.** The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest "
"available means.   \n"
"**Grovel.** The target falls prone and then ends its turn.   \n"
"**Halt.** The target doesn't move and takes no actions. A flying creature "
"stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay "
"aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air. \n"
