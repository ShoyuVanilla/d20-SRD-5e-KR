"You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-green fog centered "
"on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts "
"for the duration or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the "
"spell. Its area is heavily obscured.    \n"
"When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or "
"starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving "
"throw. The creature takes 5d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as "
"much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold "
"their breath or don't need to breathe.    \n"
"The fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, "
"rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, "
"sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings. \n"
