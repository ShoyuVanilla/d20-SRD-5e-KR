"For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you "
"cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can "
"focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of "
"you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn't "
"speak any language, the creature is unaffected.    \n"
"You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature--what is most on "
"its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention "
"to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same "
"creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving "
"throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its "
"emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as "
"something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell "
"ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and "
"unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature "
"can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by "
"your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.    \n"
"Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the "
"course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of "
"an interrogation.    \n"
"You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you "
"can't see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, "
"you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate "
"barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a "
"thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a creature with an "
"Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language.    \n"
"Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its "
"thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't "
"see it, but it must still be within range. \n"
