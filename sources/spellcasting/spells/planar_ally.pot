"You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to you: "
"a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic "
"power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it "
"to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within "
"range. If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when "
"you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a "
"different creature anyway (GM's choice).    \n"
"When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any "
"particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange "
"for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could range "
"from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex "
"(spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You "
"must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.    "
"\n"
"Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable "
"donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might "
"demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might "
"exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.    \n"
"As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a "
"payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp "
"per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per "
"day. The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which "
"you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the "
"payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require "
"only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might "
"require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.    "
"\n"
"After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of "
"service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back "
"to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to "
"agree on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately "
"returns to its home plane.    \n"
"A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a "
"full share of experience points awarded. \n"
