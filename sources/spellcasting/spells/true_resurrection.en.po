"You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years and "
"that died for any reason except old age. If the creature's soul is free and "
"willing, the creature is restored to life with all its hit points.    \n"
"This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, "
"and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces "
"damaged or missing organs and limbs.    \n"
"The spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in "
"which case you must speak the creature's name. The creature then appears in "
"an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you. \n"
