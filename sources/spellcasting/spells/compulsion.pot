"Creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear you "
"must make a Wisdom saving throw. A target automatically succeeds on this "
"saving throw if it can't be charmed. On a failed save, a target is affected "
"by this spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of "
"your turns to designate a direction that is horizontal to you. Each affected "
"target must use as much of its movement as possible to move in that "
"direction on its next turn. It can take its action before it moves. After "
"moving in this way, it can make another Wisdom saving to try to end the "
"effect.    \n"
"A target isn't compelled to move into an obviously deadly hazard, such as a "
"fire or pit, but it will provoke opportunity attacks to move in the "
"designated direction.\n"
