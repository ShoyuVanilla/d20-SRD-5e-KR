"This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new "
"form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the "
"effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit "
"points.    \n"
"The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 "
"hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is "
"equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level, if it doesn't "
"have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental "
"ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It "
"retains its alignment and personality.    \n"
"The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its "
"normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before "
"it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any "
"excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage "
"doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked "
"unconscious.    \n"
"The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its "
"new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that "
"requires hands or speech.    \n"
"The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate, use, "
"wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment. \n"
