"You assume a different form. When you cast the spell, choose one of the "
"following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the "
"spell. While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain "
"the benefits of a different one.    \n"
"**Aquatic Adaptation.** You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, "
"sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe "
"underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.    \n"
"**Change Appearance.** You transform your appearance. You decide what you "
"look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your "
"voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if "
"any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none "
"of your statistics change. You also can't appear as a creature of a "
"different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're "
"bipedal, you can't use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. At "
"any time for the duration of the spell, you can use your action to change "
"your appearance in this way again.    \n"
"**Natural Weapons.** You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different "
"natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, "
"piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you "
"chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes. Finally, the "
"natural weapon is magic and you have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage "
"rolls you make using it.\n"
