"Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory "
"creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a "
"30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must "
"make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened "
"for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature's deepest fears, "
"manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each "
"of the frightened creature's turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw "
"or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that "
"creature."
