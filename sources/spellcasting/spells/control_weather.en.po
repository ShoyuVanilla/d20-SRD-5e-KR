"You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration. You "
"must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you don't have "
"a clear path to the sky ends the spell early.    \n"
"When you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions, which "
"are determined by the GM based on the climate and season. You can change "
"precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 Ã— 10 minutes for the new "
"conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change the conditions "
"again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.    \n"
"When you change the weather conditions, find a current condition on the "
"following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing the "
"wind, you can change its direction. \n"
