"You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are "
"transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target "
"destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental "
"Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine "
"Hells, and you appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to "
"reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of "
"Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea "
"of Fire, at the GM's discretion.    \n"
"Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on "
"another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the "
"teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, "
"they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.    \n"
"You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another "
"plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack "
"against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the "
"creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on the "
"plane of existence you specify. A creature so transported must find its own "
"way back to your current plane of existence. \n"
