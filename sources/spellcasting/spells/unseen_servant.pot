"This spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs "
"simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into "
"existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 "
"hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can't attack. If it drops to 0 hit "
"points, the spell ends.    \n"
"Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the "
"servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can "
"perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, "
"cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and "
"pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to "
"the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your "
"next command.    \n"
"If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 "
"feet away from you, the spell ends.\n"
