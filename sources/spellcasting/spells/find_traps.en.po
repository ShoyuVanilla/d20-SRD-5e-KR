"You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of "
"sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would "
"inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, "
"which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell "
"would sense an area affected by the **_alarm_** spell, a **_glyph of "
"warding_**, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural "
"weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.    \n"
"This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don't learn the "
"location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger "
"posed by a trap you sense. \n"
