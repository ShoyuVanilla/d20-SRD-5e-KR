"A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot- radius, 40-foot-high "
"cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light "
"fills the cylinder.    \n"
"When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or "
"starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing "
"pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant "
"damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.    \n"
"A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it "
"also instantly reverts to its original form and can't assume a different "
"form until it leaves the spell's light.    \n"
"On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to "
"move the beam 60 feet in any direction. \n"
