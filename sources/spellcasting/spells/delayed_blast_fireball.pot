"A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to "
"linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the "
"duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken "
"or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an "
"explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a "
"20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving "
"throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on "
"a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.    \n"
"The spell's base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not "
"yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.    \n"
"If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature "
"touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell "
"ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, "
"the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or "
"a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.    \n"
"The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that "
"aren't being worn or carried. \n"
