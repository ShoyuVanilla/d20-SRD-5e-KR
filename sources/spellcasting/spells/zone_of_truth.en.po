"You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius "
"sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell "
"ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn "
"or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed "
"save, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know "
"whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.    \n"
"An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering "
"questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can "
"be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the "
"truth.\n"
