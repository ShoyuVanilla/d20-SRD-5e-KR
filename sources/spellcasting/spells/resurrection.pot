"You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century, "
"that didn't die of old age, and that isn't undead. If its soul is free and "
"willing, the target returns to life with all its hit points.    \n"
"This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the "
"creature when it died. It doesn't, however, remove magical diseases, curses, "
"and the like; if such effects aren't removed prior to casting the spell, "
"they afflict the target on its return to life.    \n"
"This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.    "
"\n"
"Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a âˆ’4 penalty to all "
"attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target "
"finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.    \n"
"Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one "
"year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you can't "
"cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability "
"checks, and saving throws. \n"
