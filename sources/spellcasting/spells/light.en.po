"You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until "
"the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim "
"light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you "
"like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the "
"light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.    \n"
"If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature "
"must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.\n"
