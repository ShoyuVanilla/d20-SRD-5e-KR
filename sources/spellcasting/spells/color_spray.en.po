"A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand. Roll "
"6d10; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can "
"effect. Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in "
"ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures "
"and creatures that can't see).    \n"
"Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each "
"creature affected by this spell is blinded until the spell ends. Subtract "
"each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature "
"with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or "
"less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected. \n"
