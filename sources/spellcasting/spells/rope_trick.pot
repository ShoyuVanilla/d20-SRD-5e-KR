"You touch a length of rope that is up to 60 feet long. One end of the rope "
"then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the "
"ground. At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to an "
"extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends.    \n"
"The extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the "
"rope. The space can hold as many as eight Medium or smaller creatures. The "
"rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear from view "
"outside the space.    \n"
"Attacks and spells can't cross through the entrance into or out of the "
"extradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it as if through a "
"3-foot-by-5- foot window centered on the rope.    \n"
"Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends.\n"
