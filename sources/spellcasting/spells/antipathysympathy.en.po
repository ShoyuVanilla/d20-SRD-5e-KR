"This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target something "
"within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is "
"no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, "
"such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an "
"aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the "
"duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura's effect.    \n"
"**Antipathy.** The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated "
"to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a "
"creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must "
"succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains "
"frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While "
"frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the "
"nearest safe spot from which it can't see the target. If the creature moves "
"more than 60 feet from the target and can't see it, the creature is no "
"longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains "
"sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.   \n"
"**Sympathy.** The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an "
"intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to "
"see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of "
"it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement "
"on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the "
"target. When the creature has done so, it can't willingly move away from the "
"target.    \n"
"If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected "
"creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described "
"below.    \n"
"**Ending the Effect.** If an affected creature ends its turn while not "
"within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom "
"saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by "
"the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as "
"magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another "
"Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.    \n"
"A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 "
"minute, after which time it can be affected again. \n"
