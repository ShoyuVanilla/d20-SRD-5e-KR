"A line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you in a "
"direction you choose for the spell's duration. Each creature that starts its "
"turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 "
"feet away from you in a direction following the line.    \n"
"Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it "
"moves when moving closer to you.    \n"
"The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and "
"similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as "
"those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish "
"them.    \n"
"As a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can "
"change the direction in which the line blasts from you.\n"
