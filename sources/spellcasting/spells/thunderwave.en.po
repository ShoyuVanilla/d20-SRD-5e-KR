"A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot "
"cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed "
"save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from "
"you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't "
"pushed.    \n"
"In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect "
"are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell's effect, and "
"the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet. \n"
