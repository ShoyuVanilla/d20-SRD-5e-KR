"You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within "
"range. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can "
"see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and "
"direction, such as \"200 feet straight downward\" or \"upward to the "
"northwest at a 45- degree angle, 300 feet.\"    \n"
"You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed what you "
"can carry. You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller "
"who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be "
"within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell.    \n"
"If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, "
"you and any creature traveling with you each take 4d6 force damage, and the "
"spell fails to teleport you. \n"
