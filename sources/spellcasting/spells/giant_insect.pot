"You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one "
"scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the "
"duration. A centipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a giant "
"spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a giant "
"scorpion.    \n"
"Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your "
"turn each round. The GM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves "
"their actions and movement.    \n"
"A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 "
"hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.    \n"
"The GM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you "
"transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a giant "
"wasp. \n"
