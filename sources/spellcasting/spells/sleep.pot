"This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d8; the total is "
"how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 "
"feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of "
"their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).    \n"
"Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each "
"creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the "
"sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper "
"awake. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on "
"to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points "
"must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be "
"affected.    \n"
"Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren't affected by this "
