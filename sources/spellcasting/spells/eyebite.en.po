"For the spell's duration, your eyes become an inky void imbued with dread "
"power. One creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that you can see "
"must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by one of the following "
"effects of your choice for the duration. On each of your turns until the "
"spell ends, you can use your action to target another creature but can't "
"target a creature again if it has succeeded on a saving throw against this "
"casting of **_eyebite_**.    \n"
"**Asleep.** The target falls unconscious. It wakes up if it takes any damage "
"or if another creature uses its action to shake the sleeper awake.    \n"
"**Panicked.** The target is frightened of you. On each of its turns, the "
"frightened creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the "
"safest and shortest available route, unless there is nowhere to move. If the "
"target moves to a place at least 60 feet away from you where it can no "
"longer see you, this effect ends.    \n"
"**Sickened.** The target has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability "
"checks. At the end of each of its turns, it can make another Wisdom saving "
"throw. If it succeeds, the effect ends.\n"
