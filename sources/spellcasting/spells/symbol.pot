"When you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface "
"(such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within an object that "
"can be closed to conceal the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure "
"chest). If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface "
"no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object "
"must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from "
"where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without "
"being triggered.    \n"
"The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) "
"check against your spell save DC to find it.    \n"
"You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs "
"inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or "
"stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching "
"within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds "
"it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are "
"opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing "
"or reading the glyph.    \n"
"You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under "
"certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics "
"(such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be "
"set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that "
"don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.    \n"
"When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its "
"effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere "
"with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each "
"creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, "
"as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends "
"its turn there.    \n"
"**Death.** Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 "
"necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful "
"save.    \n"
"**Discord.** Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed "
"save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During "
"this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage "
"on attack rolls and ability checks.    \n"
"**Fear.** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened "
"for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever "
"it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of "
"its turns, if able.    \n"
"**Hopelessness.** Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed "
"save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, "
"it can't attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or "
"other magical effects.    \n"
"**Insanity.** Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a "
"failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature "
"can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, "
"and speaks only in gibberish. The GM controls its movement, which is "
"erratic.    \n"
"**Pain.** Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes "
"incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.    \n"
"**Sleep.** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious "
"for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if "
"someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.    \n"
"**Stunning.** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes "
"stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.\n"
