"You project a phantasmal image of a creature's worst fears. Each creature in "
"a 30-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is "
"holding and become frightened for the duration.    \n"
"While frightened by this spell, a creature must take the Dash action and "
"move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, "
"unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location "
"where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom "
"saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature. \n"
