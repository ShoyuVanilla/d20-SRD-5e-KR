"Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against "
"certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, "
"fiends, and undead.    \n"
"The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have "
"disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be "
"charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, "
"frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any "
"new saving throw against the relevant effect.\n"
