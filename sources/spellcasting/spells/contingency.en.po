"Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting "
"time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that spell--called the "
"contingent spell--as part of casting **_contingency_**, expending spell "
"slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't come into effect. Instead, "
"it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that "
"circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a **_contingency_** "
"cast with **_water breathing_** might stipulate that **_water breathing_** "
"comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.    \n"
"The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met "
"for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then "
"**_contingency_** ends. The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even "
"if it can normally target others. You can use only one **_contingency_** "
"spell at a time.    \n"
"If you cast this spell again, the effect of another **_contingency_** spell "
"on you ends. Also, **_contingency_** ends on you if its material component "
"is ever not on your person.\n"
