"A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size or "
"smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving "
"throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.    \n"
"Nothing--not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects--can pass "
"through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe "
"there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside "
"can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a "
"creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.    \n"
"The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or "
"object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the "
"sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's "
"speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.    "
"\n"
"A **_disintegrate_** spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming "
"anything inside it. \n"
