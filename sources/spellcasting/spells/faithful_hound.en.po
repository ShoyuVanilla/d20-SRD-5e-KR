"You conjure a phantom watchdog in an unoccupied space that you can see "
"within range, where it remains for the duration, until you dismiss it as an "
"action, or until you move more than 100 feet away from it.    \n"
"The hound is invisible to all creatures except you and can't be harmed. When "
"a Small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking "
"the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the hound starts "
"barking loudly. The hound sees invisible creatures and can see into the "
"Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.    \n"
"At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one creature "
"within 5 feet of it that is hostile to you. The hound's attack bonus is "
"equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a "
"hit, it deals 4d8 piercing damage. \n"
