"A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the "
"duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright "
"light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell "
"ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.    \n"
"You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When "
"you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame "
"at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, "
"the target takes 1d8 fire damage.    \n"
"This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th "
"level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8). \n"
