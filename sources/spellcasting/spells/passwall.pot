"A passage appears at a point of your choice that you can see on a wooden, "
"plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, a ceiling, or a floor) within "
"range, and lasts for the duration. You choose the opening's dimensions: up "
"to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage creates no "
"instability in a structure surrounding it.    \n"
