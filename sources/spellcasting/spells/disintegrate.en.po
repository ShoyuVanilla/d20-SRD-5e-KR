"A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can "
"see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of "
"magical force, such as the wall created by **_wall of force_**.    \n"
"A creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a "
"failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. If this damage reduces "
"the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.    \n"
"A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except "
"magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be "
"restored to life only by means of a **_true resurrection_** or a **_wish_** "
"spell.    \n"
"This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object "
"or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or "
"creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot- cube portion of it. A "
"magic item is unaffected by this spell. \n"
