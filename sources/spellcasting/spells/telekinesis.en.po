"You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by "
"thought. When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the "
"duration, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can see "
"within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect the same "
"target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If you switch "
"targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.    \n"
"**Creature.** You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an "
"ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by the creature's "
"Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet "
"in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this "
"spell. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is restrained in your "
"telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.    \n"
"On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain your "
"telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.    \n"
"**Object.** You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If "
"the object isn't being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 "
"feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell.    \n"
"If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability "
"check with your spellcasting ability contested by that creature's Strength "
"check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can "
"move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this "
"spell.    \n"
"You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as "
"manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or "
"retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a "
"vial. \n"
