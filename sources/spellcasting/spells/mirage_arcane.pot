"You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and even "
"feel like some other sort of terrain. The terrain's general shape remains "
"the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, "
"hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be "
"made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a "
"rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.    \n"
"Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where "
"none are present. The spell doesn't disguise, conceal, or add creatures.    "
"\n"
"The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so "
"it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise "
"impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as "
"a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell's area disappears "
"immediately.    \n"
"Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain's true "
"form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the "
"creature is aware of the illusion's presence, the creature can still "
"physically interact with the illusion. \n"
