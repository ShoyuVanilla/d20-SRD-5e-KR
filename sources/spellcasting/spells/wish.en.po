"**_Wish_** is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply "
"speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with "
"your desires.    \n"
"The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or "
"lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including "
"costly components. The spell simply takes effect.    \n"
"Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\n"
"* You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic "
"item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it "
"appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground. \n"
"* You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit "
"points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration "
"spell.\n"
"* You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type "
"you choose. \n"
"* You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or "
"other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and "
"all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack.\n"
"* You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within "
"the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to "
"accommodate the new result. For example, a **_wish_** spell could undo an "
"opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed "
"save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, "
"and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll. \n"

"You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above "
"examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has "
"great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the "
"wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might "
"simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you "
"might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the "
"wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward "
"in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively "
"removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or "
"artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current "
"owner.    \n"
"The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than "
"duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time "
"you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage "
"per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any "
"way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, "
"for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing "
"nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by "
"2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast "
"**_wish_** ever again if you suffer this stress. \n"
