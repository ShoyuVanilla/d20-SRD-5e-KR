"This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100- foot high cylinder "
"centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects that aren't "
"somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of "
"the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving "
"throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.    "
"\n"
"If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, "
"falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal "
"downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without "
"striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the "
"duration.    \n"
"At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back "
"down. \n"
