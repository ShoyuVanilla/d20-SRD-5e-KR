"Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell "
"ends, the target's speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has "
"advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on "
"each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one "
"weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. When "
"the spell ends, the target can't move or take actions until after its next "
"turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it."
