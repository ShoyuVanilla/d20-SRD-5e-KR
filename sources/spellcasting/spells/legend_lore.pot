"Name or describe a person, place, or object. The spell brings to your mind a "
"brief summary of the significant lore about the thing you named. The lore "
"might consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret lore that "
"has never been widely known. If the thing you named isn't of legendary "
"importance, you gain no information. The more information you already have "
"about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you receive "
"is.    \n"
"The information you learn is accurate but might be couched in figurative "
"language. For example, if you have a mysterious magic axe on hand, the spell "
"might yield this information: â€œWoe to the evildoer whose hand touches the "
"axe, for even the haft slices the hand of the evil ones. Only a true Child "
"of Stone, lover and beloved of Moradin, may awaken the true powers of the "
"axe, and only with the sacred word **Rudnogg** on the lips.\"\n"
