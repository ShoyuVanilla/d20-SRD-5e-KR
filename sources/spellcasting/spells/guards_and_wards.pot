"You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an "
"area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot "
"squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you "
"desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area "
"among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are "
"casting the spell.    \n"
"When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by "
"any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password "
"that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.    \n"
"**_Guards and wards_** creates the following effects within the warded "
"area.   \n"
"**Corridors.** Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily "
"obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a "
"choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than "
"you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it "
"chooses.    \n"
"**Doors.** All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed "
"by an **_arcane lock_** spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors "
"with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the **_minor "
"illusion_** spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.    \n"
"**Stairs.** Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as "
"the **_web_** spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned "
"or torn away while **_guards and wards_** lasts.    \n"
"**Other Spell Effect.** You can place your choice of one of the following "
"magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold.\n"
