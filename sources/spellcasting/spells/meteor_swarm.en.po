"Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can "
"see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each "
"point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads "
"around corners. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning "
"damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A "
"creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.    "
"\n"
"The spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that "
"aren't being worn or carried. \n"
