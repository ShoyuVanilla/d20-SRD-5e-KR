"You convert raw materials into products of the same material. For example, "
"you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch "
"of hemp, and clothes from flax or wool.    \n"
"Choose raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a "
"Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected "
"5-foot cubes), given a sufficient quantity of raw material. If you are "
"working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the "
"fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a single "
"5-foot cube). The quality of objects made by the spell is commensurate with "
"the quality of the raw materials.    \n"
"Creatures or magic items can't be created or transmuted by this spell. You "
"also can't use it to create items that ordinarily require a high degree of "
"craftsmanship, such as jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor, unless you have "
"proficiency with the type of artisan's tools used to craft such objects. \n"
