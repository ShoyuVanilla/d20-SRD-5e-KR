"You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The "
"copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, "
"regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you "
"but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the "
"spell ends.    \n"
"You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and "
"make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics "
"your mannerisms perfectly.    \n"
"You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its "
"space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses "
"to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are "
"blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.    \n"
"Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because "
"things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the "
"image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence "
"(Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the "
"illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any "
"noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature. \n"
