"You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that the "
"creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult "
"body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body. If the target's soul "
"isn't free or willing to do so, the spell fails.    \n"
"The magic fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit, which likely "
"causes the creature's race to change. The GM rolls a d100 and consults the "
"following table to determine what form the creature takes when restored to "
"life, or the GM chooses a form. \n"
