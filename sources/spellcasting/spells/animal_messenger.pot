"By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a "
"Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a "
"bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient "
"who matches a general description, such as \"a man or woman dressed in the "
"uniform of the town guard\" or \"a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.\" "
"You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast "
"travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified location, "
"covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles for "
"other animals.    \n"
"When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that "
"you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks "
"only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger "
"doesn't reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, "
"and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell. \n"
