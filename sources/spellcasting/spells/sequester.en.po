"By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden away, "
"safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and touch the "
"target, it becomes invisible and can't be targeted by divination spells or "
"perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.    \n"
"If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended "
"animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn't grow older.    \n"
"You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be "
"anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the "
"target. Examples include \"after 1,000 years\" or \"when the tarrasque "
"awakens.\" This spell also ends if the target takes any damage. \n"
