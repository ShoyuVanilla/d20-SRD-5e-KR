"You summon a spirit that assumes the form of an unusually intelligent, "
"strong, and loyal steed, creating a long-lasting bond with it. Appearing in "
"an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes on a form that you choose: "
"a warhorse, a pony, a camel, an elk, or a mastiff. (Your GM might allow "
"other animals to be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the "
"chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead "
"of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or "
"less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one "
"language of your choice that you speak.    \n"
"Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an "
"instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While "
"mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you "
"also target your steed.    \n"
"When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no "
"physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, "
"causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons "
"the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.    \n"
"While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it "
"telepathically.    \n"
"You can't have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time. As an "
"action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time, causing it to "
"disappear. \n"
