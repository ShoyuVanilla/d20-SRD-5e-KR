"Whispering to the spirits of nature, you create one of the following effects "
"within range: * You create a tiny, harmless sensory effect that predicts "
"what the weather will be at your location for the next 24 hours. The effect "
"might manifest as a golden orb for clear skies, a cloud for rain, falling "
"snowflakes for snow, and so on. This effect persists for 1 round.  * You "
"instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom.  * "
"You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as falling "
"leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a small animal, or the faint odor of "
"skunk. The effect must fit in a 5-foot cube.  * You instantly light or snuff "
"out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire."
