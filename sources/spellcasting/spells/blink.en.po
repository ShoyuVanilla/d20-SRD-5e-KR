"Roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the duration of the "
"spell. On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your current plane of "
"existence and appear in the Ethereal Plane (the spell fails and the casting "
"is wasted if you were already on that plane). At the start of your next "
"turn, and when the spell ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane, you return "
"to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the "
"space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available within that "
"range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more "
"than one space is equally near). You can dismiss this spell as an action.    "
"\n"
"While on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear the plane you originated "
"from, which is cast in shades of gray, and you can't see anything there more "
"than 60 feet away. You can only affect and be affected by other creatures on "
"the Ethereal Plane. Creatures that aren't there can't perceive you or "
"interact with you, unless they have the ability to do so. \n"
