"A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a "
"60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see 100 feet directly above "
"you. The spell fails if you can't see a point in the air where the storm "
"cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can't accommodate "
"the cloud).    \n"
"When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see within range. A bolt of "
"lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 "
"feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 "
"lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful "
"one. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to "
"call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a "
"different one.    \n"
"If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell "
"gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new "
"one. Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases by 1d10. \n"
