"touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on "
"the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the "
"target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can't take reactions until the "
"start of its next turn.    \n"
"The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th "
"level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8). \n"
