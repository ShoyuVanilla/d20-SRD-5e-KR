"A 10-foot-radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around and "
"above you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell ends if you "
"leave its area.    \n"
"Nine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with "
"you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than "
"nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this "
"spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred "
"from passing through it. Spells and other magical effects can't extend "
"through the dome or be cast through it. The atmosphere inside the space is "
"comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.    \n"
"Until the spell ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit or "
"dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you choose, but it "
"is transparent from the inside. \n"
