"A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide, "
"60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving "
"throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded "
"until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and "
"isn't blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this "
"saving throw.    \n"
"You can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until the "
"spell ends.    \n"
"For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It sheds "
"bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 "
"feet. This light is sunlight. \n"
