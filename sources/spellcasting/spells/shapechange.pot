"You assume the form of a different creature for the duration. The new form "
"can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or "
"lower. The creature can't be a construct or an undead, and you must have "
"seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an average "
"example of that creature, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting "
"trait.    \n"
"Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, "
"though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma "
"scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in "
"addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same "
"proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than "
"yours, use the creature's bonus in place of yours. You can't use any "
"legendary actions or lair actions of the new form.    \n"
"You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to "
"your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you "
"transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any "
"excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage "
"doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked "
"unconscious.    \n"
"You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other "
"source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable "
"of doing so. You can't use any special senses you have (for example, "
"darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if "
"the creature can normally speak.    \n"
"When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, "
"merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as "
"normal. The GM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a "
"piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment "
"doesn't change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that "
"the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your "
"new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.    \n"
"During this spell's duration, you can use your action to assume a different "
"form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with "
"one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, "
"your hit points remain at their current value. \n"
