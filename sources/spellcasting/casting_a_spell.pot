"# Casting a Spell \n"
"When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, "
"regardless of the character's class or the spell's effects.    \n"
"Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the "
"spell's name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and "
"duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell's effect. \n"

"## Casting Time Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells "
"require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast."

"### Bonus Action A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You "
"must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you "
"haven't already taken a bonus action this turn. You can't cast another spell "
"during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action."

"### Reactions Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a "
"fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some "
"event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you "
"exactly when you can do so."

"### Longer Casting Times Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) "
"require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with "
"a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your "
"action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration "
"while you do so. If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you "
"don't expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you "
"must start over."

"## Range \n"
"The target of a spell must be within the spell's range. For a spell like "
"**_magic missile_**, the target is a creature. For a spell like "
"**_fireball_**, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire "
"erupts.    \n"
"Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a "
"creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the "
"**_shield_** spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.    "
"\n"
"Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also "
"have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell's effect "
"must be you.    \n"
"Once a spell is cast, its effects aren't limited by its range, unless the "
"spell's description says otherwise. \n"

"## Components A spell's components are the physical requirements you must "
"meet in order to cast it. Each spell's description indicates whether it "
"requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can't "
"provide one or more of a spell's components, you are unable to cast the "
"spell."

msgid ""
"### Verbal (V)  Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words "
"themselves aren't the source of the spell's power; rather, the particular "
"combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads "
"of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of "
"silence, such as one created by the **_silence_** spell, can't cast a spell "
"with a verbal component."

"### Somatic (S)  Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful "
"gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic "
"component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform "
"these gestures."

"### Material (M) \n"
"Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in "
"the component entry. A character can use a **component pouch** or a "
"**spellcasting focus** (found in “Equipment”) in place of the components "
"specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a "
"character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the "
"spell.    \n"
"If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the "
"caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell. A "
"spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell's material "
"components--or to hold a spellcasting focus--but it can be the same hand "
"that he or she uses to perform somatic components. \n"

"## Duration A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. A "
"duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some "
"spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or "
"destroyed."

"### Instantaneous Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, "

"### Concentration \n"
"Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their "
"magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.    \n"
"If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its "
"Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on "
"it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).    \n"
"Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with "
"concentration. The following factors can break concentration:\n"

"**Taking damage.** Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a "
"spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your "

"## Targets \n"
"A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by "
"the spell's magic. A spell's description tells you whether the spell targets "
"creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described "
"below).   \n"
"Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was "
"targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, "
"but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature's thoughts, "
"typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise. \n"

msgid ""
"### A Clear Path to the Target To target something, you must have a clear "
"path to it, so it can't be behind total cover. If you place an area of "
"effect at a point that you can't see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is "
"between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near "
"side of that obstruction."

"### Targeting Yourself If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can "
"choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a "
"creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you "
"cast, you can target yourself. Areas of Effect Spells such as burning hands "
"and cone of cold cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures "

"## Areas of Effect \n"
"Spells such as **_burning hands_** and **_cone of cold_** cover an area, "
"allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.   \n"
"A spell's description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one "
"of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area "
"of effect has a **point of origin**, a location from which the spell's "
"energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point "
"of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells "
"have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.    \n"
"A spell's effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no "
"unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location "
"within the area of effect, that location isn't included in the spell's "
"area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide "
"total cover. \n"

"A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone's "

"ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder "
"expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the "
"circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell's effect then shoots up "

"> #### The Schools of Magic \n"
"> Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools of "
"magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all spells, "
"believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it "
"derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.    \n"
"> The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their "
"own, although some rules refer to the schools.    \n"
"> **Abjuration** spells are protective in nature, though some of them have "
"aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm "
"trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.    \n"
"> **Conjuration** spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures "
"from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the "
"caster's side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another "
"location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.    \n"
"> **Divination** spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets "
"long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the "
"truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.   \n"
"> **Enchantment** spells affect the minds of others, influencing or "
"controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a "
"friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another "
"creature like a puppet.    \n"
"> **Evocation** spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired "
"effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive "
"energy to heal wounds.    \n"
"> **Illusion** spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause "
"people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to "
"hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some "
"illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most "
"insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.    \n"
"> **Necromancy** spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such "
"spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from "
"another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life.    "
"\n"
"> Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as animate "
"dead is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently.    "
"\n"
"> **Transmutation** spells change the properties of a creature, object, or "
"environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the "
"strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster's command, or enhance "
"a creature's innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury. \n"

"## Combining Magical Effects \n"
"The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those "
"spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't "
"combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect--such as the highest "
"bonus--from those castings applies while their durations overlap.   \n"
"For example, if two clerics cast bless on the same target, that character "
"gains the spell's benefit only once; he or she doesn't get to roll two bonus "
"dice.\n"
