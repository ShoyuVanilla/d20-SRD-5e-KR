"# Alignment \n"
"A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly "
"describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of "
"two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other "
"describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or "
"neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.    "
"\n"
"These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior "
"of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from "
"that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently "
"faithful to the precepts of their alignment. \n"

"**Lawful good (LG)** creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as "
"expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful "
"good.    \n"
"**Neutral good (NG)** folk do the best they can to help others according to "
"their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral "
"good.    \n"
"**Chaotic good (CG)** creatures act as their conscience directs, with little "
"regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are "
"chaotic good.   \n"
"**Lawful neutral (LN)** individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, "
"or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral.    \n"
"**Neutral (N)** is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral "
"questions and don't take sides, doing what seems best at the "
"time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral.    \n"
"**Chaotic neutral (CN)** creatures follow their whims, holding their "
"personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, "
"are chaotic neutral.    \n"
"**Lawful evil (LE)** creatures methodically take what they want, within the "
"limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and "
"hobgoblins are lawful evil.    \n"
"**Neutral evil (NE)** is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get "
"away with, without compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and "
"goblins are neutral evil.    \n"
"**Chaotic evil (CE)** creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by "
"their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are chaotic "
"evil. \n"

"### Alignment in the Multiverse \n"
"For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, "
"elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of "
"good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-aligned gods who "
"created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing "
"that good without free will is slavery.     \n"
"The evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to serve "
"them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of "
"their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc gods, and "
"are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a good alignment, it "
"struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs "
"feel the lingering pull of the orc god's influence.)    \n"
"Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A "
"devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn't tend toward lawful "
"evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to "
"be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil.    \n"
"Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have "
"alignments - they are **unaligned**. Such a creature is incapable of making "
"a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks "
"are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no "
"alignment.\n"

"# Backgrounds \n"
"Every story has a beginning. Your character's background reveals where you "
"came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your "
"fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your "
"wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by "
"as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.    \n"
"Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your "
"character's identity. The most important question to ask about your "
"background is **what changed**? Why did you stop doing whatever your "
"background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to "
"purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why "
"don't you have **more** money? How did you learn the skills of your class? "
"What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?    \n"
"The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete benefits "
"(features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions. \n"

"### Proficiencies \n"
"Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills.   \n"
"In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more "
"tools.    \n"
"If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, "
"he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or "
"tool) instead. \n"

"### Suggested Characteristics A background contains suggested personal "
"characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll "
"dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for "
"characteristics of your own creation. Customizing a Background You might "
"want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your "
"character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can "
"replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a "
"total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample "
"backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background "
"or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment section. (If you spend "
"coin, you can't also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) "
"Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one "
"flaw. If you can't find a feature that matches your desired background, work "
"with your GM to create one."

"## Acolyte \n"
"You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or "
"pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy "
"and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in "
"order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not "
"necessarily a cleric - performing sacred rites is not the same thing as "
"channeling divine power.    \n"
"Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being from "
"among those listed in \"Fantasy--Historical Pantheons\" or those specified "
"by your GM, and work with your GM to detail the nature of your religious "
"service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to "
"assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who "
"suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps "
"you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple "
"structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you "

"### Feature: Shelter of the Faithful \n"
"As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and "

"temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must "

"You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity "
"or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where "
"you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where "

"needs of their environment. Given the necessity of raiding for food and "
"wealth, it's surprising the mortals turned out as well as they did. Their "
"powers reflect the need these warriors had for strong leadership and "
"decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in every bend of a river, hear "
"them in the crash of the thunder and the booming of the glaciers, and smell "
"them in the smoke of a burning longhouse.    \n"
"The Norse pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of war and "
