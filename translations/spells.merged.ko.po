"This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target something "

"object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more "
"than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the "
"spell ends without being triggered.    \n"
"The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence "
"(Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.    \n"
"You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs "
"inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or "
"standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, "
"approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the "
"object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an "
"object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching "
"within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the "
"glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.    \n"
"You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain "
"circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or "
"weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect "
"aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for "
"creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain "
"password.    \n"

"glyph**.    \n"
"**Explosive Runes.** When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in "
"a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around "

"damage on a successful one.    \n"
"**Spell Glyph.** You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the "
"glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a "
"single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect "

"cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the "

"perceive the target.    \n"
"When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of "
"imprisonment.    \n"
"**Burial.** The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of "
"magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can "
"pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel "
"to get into or out of it.    \n"

"be moved by any means until then.    \n"
"The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of "

"**Hedged Prison.** The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane "
"that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be "
"a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of "
"your choice.    \n"
"The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature "
"representation of the prison made from jade.    \n"
"**Minimus Containment.** The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is "
"imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the "
"gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see "
"in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or "
"planar travel. The gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell remains "
"in effect.    \n"
"The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent "
"gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.    \n"
"**Slumber.** The target falls asleep and can't be awoken. The special "
"component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.    "
"\n"
"**Ending the Spell.** During the casting of the spell, in any of its "
"versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and "
"release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you "
"choose, but the GM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a "
"likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's "
"name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions "
"or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit "
"points.    \n"
"A **_dispel magic_** spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a "
"9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used "
"to create it.    \n"
"You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a "
"time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of "
"the first casting is immediately freed from its binding. \n"

"range. If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when "
"you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a "

"When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any "

"from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex "
"(spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You "

"Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable "
"donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might "
"demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might "
"exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.    \n"
"As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a "
"payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp "
"per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per "

"you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the "
"payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require "
"only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might "
"require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.    "
"\n"

"**Familiarity.** \"Permanent circle\" means a permanent teleportation circle "
"whose sigil sequence you know. \"Associated object\" means that you possess "
"an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, "
"such as a book from a wizard's library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a "
"chunk of marble from a lich's secret tomb.    \n"
"\"Very familiar\" is a place you have been very often, a place you have "
"carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. \"Seen "
"casually\" is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you "
"aren't very familiar. \"Viewed once\" is a place you have seen once, "
"possibly using magic. \"Description\" is a place whose location and "
"appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map.    "
"\n"
"\"False destination\" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to "
"scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are "
"attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.    \n"
"**On Target.** You and your group (or the target object) appear where you "
"want to.    \n"
"**Off Target.** You and your group (or the target object) appear a random "
"distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off "
"target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For "
"example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 "
"and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 "
"miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 "
"and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the "
"points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound "
"up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.    \n"
"**Similar Area.** You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a "
"different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target "
"area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might "
"wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that "
"has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you "
"appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, "
"you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.    \n"
"**Mishap.** The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult "
"journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force "
"damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple "
"mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time). \n"

"**_Wish_** is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply "
"speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with "
"your desires.    \n"
"The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or "
"lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including "
"costly components. The spell simply takes effect.    \n"
"Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\n"
"* You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic "
"item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it "
"appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground. \n"
"* You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit "
"points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration "
"spell.\n"
"* You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type "
"you choose. \n"
"* You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or "
"other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and "
"all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack.\n"
"* You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within "
"the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to "
"accommodate the new result. For example, a **_wish_** spell could undo an "
"opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed "
"save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, "
"and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll. \n"

"You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above "
"examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has "
"great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the "
"wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might "
"simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you "
"might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the "
"wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward "
"in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively "
"removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or "
"artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current "
"owner.    \n"
"The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than "
"duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time "
"you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage "
"per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any "
"way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, "
"for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing "
"nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by "
"2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast "
"**_wish_** ever again if you suffer this stress. \n"
