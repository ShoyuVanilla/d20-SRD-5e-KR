"# Ability Checks \n"
"An ability check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and training "
"in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an ability check when "
"a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a "
"chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the "
"results.    \n"
"For every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is "
"relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by "
"a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The "
"Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.\n"

"To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability "
"modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare "
"the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability "
"check is a success--the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, "
"it's a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress "
"toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by "
"the GM."

"## Contests \n"
"Sometimes one character's or monster's efforts are directly opposed to "
"another's. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing "
"and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that "
"has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is "
"trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal--for example, when "
"a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding "
"closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special "
"form of ability check, called a contest.   \n"
"Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their "
"efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of "
"comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two "
"checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That "
"character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one "
"from succeeding.   \n"
"If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was "
"before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by "
"default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, "
"neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a "
"door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the "
"door remains shut. \n"

"## Skills \n"
"Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a "
"character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific "
"aspect of an ability score, and an individual's proficiency in a skill "
"demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character's starting skill "
"proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster's skill "
"proficiencies appear in the monster's stat block.)   \n"
"For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character's attempt to pull "
"off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these "
"aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, "
"and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth "
"skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and "
"hiding.   \n"
"The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following "
"list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability's description "
"in the later sections of this section for examples of how to use a skill "
"associated with an ability. \n"

"Sometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill--for "
"example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.” At other times, a player might "
"ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In "
"either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her "
"proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without "
"proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.    \n"
"For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM "
"might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient "
"in Athletics, the character's proficiency bonus is added to the Strength "
"check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a "
"Strength check. \n"

"### Variant: Skills with Different Abilities Normally, your proficiency in a "
"skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in "
"Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some "
"situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different "
"kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual "
"combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply "
"a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an "
"offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check "
"to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM "
"might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a "
"Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you're proficient in Athletics, you "
"apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would "
"normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your "
"half-­‐‑orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, "
"your GM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though "
"Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma."

"## Passive Checks \n"
"A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any "
"die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done "
"repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can "
"be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters "
"succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden "
"monster.    \n"

"subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a **score**.   \n"

"Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.    \n"

"## Working Together \n"
"Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character "
"who's leading the effort--or the one with the highest ability modifier--can "
"make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the "
"other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.    \n"
"A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could "
"attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with "
"thieves' tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can't help another "
"character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more "
"individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such "
"as threading a needle, are no easier with help. \n"

"### Group Checks \n"
"When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, "
"the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the "
"characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who "
"aren't.    \n"
"To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability "
"check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds.    \n"
"Otherwise, the group fails. Group checks don't come up very often, and "
"they're most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For "
"example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a "
"group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the "
"quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at "
"least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide "
"their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of "
"these hazards.\n"

"## Ability Scores and Modifiers \n"
"Each of a creature's abilities has a score, a number that defines the "
"magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate "
"capabilities, but also encompasses a creature's training and competence in "
"activities related to that ability.    \n"
"A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many "
"monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the "
"highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high "
"as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.    \n"
"Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 "
"(for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores "
"and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible "

"## Charisma Checks \n"
"A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, "
"when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are "
"navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, "
"Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of "
"Charisma checks.   \n"
"**Deception.** Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can "
"convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This "
"deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity "
"to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a "
"guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a "
"disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a "
"straight face while telling a blatant lie.    \n"
"**Intimidation.** When you attempt to influence someone through overt "
"threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to "
"make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry "
"information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a "
"confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering "
"vizier to reconsider a decision.   \n"
"**Performance.** Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you "
"can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some "
"other form of entertainment.   \n"
"**Persuasion.** When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people "
"with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a "
"Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in "
"good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper "
"etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to "
"let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or "
"inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.    \n"

">#### Hiding \n"
">The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try "
"to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you "
"stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) "
"check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.   "
"\n"
">You can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away "
"your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over "
"a vase. \n"
">An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might "
"still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.   \n"
">In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if "
"you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees "
"you. However, under certain circumstances, the DM might allow you to stay "
"hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain "
"advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.   \n"
">**Passive Perception.** When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice "
"you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature "
"notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that "
"creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the "
"creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If "
"the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For "
"example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a "
"Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a "
"passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.    \n"
">**What Can You See?** One of the main factors in determining whether you "

"# Saving Throws \n"
"A saving throw--also called a save--represents an attempt to resist a spell, "
"a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don’t normally decide "
"to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or "
"monster is at risk of harm.   \n"
"To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability "
"modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity "
"saving throw.   \n"
"A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be "
"affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM.    \n"
"Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for "
"example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, "
"proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency "
"bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters "
"have saving throw proficiencies as well.    \n"
"The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that "
"causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is "
"determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.    \n"
"The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the "
"effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a "
"creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.\n"

"## Lifting and Carrying \n"
"Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The "
"following terms define what you can lift or carry.    \n"
"**Carrying Capacity.** Your carrying capacity is your Strength score "
"multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which "
"is high enough that most characters don't usually have to worry about it.   "
"\n"
"**Push, Drag, or Lift.** You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up "
"to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While "
"pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed "
"drops to 5 feet.    \n"
"**Size and Strength.** Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny "
"creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the "
"creature's carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For "
"a Tiny creature, halve these weights. \n"

"character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, "
"ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.    \n"
"If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are "
"**encumbered**, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.    \n"
"If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your "
"maximum carrying capacity, you are instead **heavily encumbered**, which "
"means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability "
"checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or "
"Constitution.\n"

"## Wisdom Checks\n"
"A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand "
"someone’s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an "
"injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and "
"Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.    \n"
"**Animal Handling.** When there is any question whether you can calm down a "
"domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an "
"animal’s intentions, the GM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) "
"check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount "
"when you attempt a risky maneuver.    \n"
"**Insight.** Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine "
"the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or "
"predicting someone’s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body "
"language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.    \n"
"**Medicine.** A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying "
"companion or diagnose an illness.   \n"
"**Perception.** Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or "
"otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general "
"awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, "
"you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under "
"an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you "
"might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are "
"orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or "
"candlelight under a closed secret door.   \n"
"**Survival.** The GM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to "
"follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, "
"identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid "
"quicksand and other natural hazards.    \n"
