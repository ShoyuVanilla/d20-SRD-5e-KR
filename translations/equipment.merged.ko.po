"# Adventuring Gear \n"
"This section describes items that have special rules or require further "
"explanation.     \n"
"**Acid.** As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a "
"creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it "
"on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or "
"object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target "
"takes 2d6 acid damage.    \n"
"**Alchemist's Fire.** This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to "
"air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on "
"impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the "
"alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 "
"fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this "
"damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the "
"flames.    \n"
"**Antitoxin.** A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on "
"saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or "
"constructs.    \n"
"**Arcane Focus.** An arcane focus is a special item--an orb, a crystal, a "
"rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some "
"similar item--designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, "
"warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.    \n"
"**Ball Bearings.** As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from "
"their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A "
"creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity "
"saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed "
"doesn't need to make the save.    \n"
"**Block and Tackle.** A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them "
"and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up "
"to four times the weight you can normally lift.    \n"
"**Book.** A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information "
"pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish "
"contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text "
"or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this "
"section).    \n"
"**Caltrops.** As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a "
"square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must "
"succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take "
"1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature's walking speed "
"by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature "
"moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the save.    \n"
"**Candle.** For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and "
"dim light for an additional 5 feet.   \n"
"**Case, Crossbow Bolt.** This wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow "
"bolts.   \n"
"**Case, Map or Scroll.** This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten "
"rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment.    \n"
"**Chain.** A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC "
"20 Strength check.   \n"
"**Climber's Kit.** A climber's kit includes special pitons, boot tips, "
"gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber's kit as an action to anchor "
"yourself; when you do, you can't fall more than 25 feet from the point where "
"you anchored yourself, and you can't climb more than 25 feet away from that "
"point without undoing the anchor.   \n"
"**Component Pouch.** A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt "
"pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other "
"special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that "
"have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell's description).   \n"
"**Crowbar.** Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the "
"crowbar's leverage can be applied.   \n"
"**Druidic Focus.** A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a "
"wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out "
"of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and "
"teeth from sacred animals. A druid can use such an object as a spellcasting "
"focus.   \n"
"**Fishing Tackle.** This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood "
"bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting.   \n"
"**Healer's Kit.** This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, "
"and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of "
"the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to "
"make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.   \n"
"**Holy Symbol.** A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It "
"might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol "
"carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding "
"a fragment of a sacred relic. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a "
"spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it "
"in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.   \n"
"**Holy Water.** As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto "
"a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on "
"impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, "
"treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or "
"undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage.   \n"
"A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special "
"ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered "
"silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.    \n"
"**Hunting Trap.** When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a "
"saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure "
"plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile "
"object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that "
"steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take "
"1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks "
"free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain "
"(typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 "
"Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a "
"success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.    "
"\n"
"**Lamp.** A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an "
"additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of "
"oil.   \n"
"**Lantern, Bullseye.** A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot "
"cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours "
"on a flask (1 pint) of oil.   \n"
"**Lantern, Hooded.** A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius "
"and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a "
"flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the "
"light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.    \n"
"**Lock.** A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature "
"proficient with thieves' tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 "
"Dexterity check. Your GM may decide that better locks are available for "
"higher prices.   \n"
"**Magnifying Glass.** This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is "
"also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting "
"fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as "
"sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to "
"ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to "
"appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed.   \n"
"**Manacles.** These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium "
"creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity "
"check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of "
"manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with "
"thieves' tools can pick the manacles' lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity "
"check. Manacles have 15 hit points.   \n"
"**Mess Kit.** This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps "
"together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate "
"or shallow bowl.   \n"
"**Oil.** Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, "
"you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or "
"throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack "
"against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised "
"weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire "
"damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional "
"5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the "
"ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If "
"lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that "
"enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this "
"damage only once per turn.   \n"
"**Poison, Basic.** You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing "
"or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison "
"takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must "
"make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once "
"applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.   \n"
"**Potion of Healing.** A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this "
"vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an "
"action.   \n"
"**Pouch.** A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 "
"blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding "
"spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this "
"section).   \n"
"**Quiver.** A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows.   \n"
"**Ram, Portable.** You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When "
"doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can "
"help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.   \n"
"**Rations.** Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, "
"including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.   \n"
"**Rope.** Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be "
"burst with a DC 17 Strength check.   \n"
"**Scale, Merchant's.** A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a "
"suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the "
"exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, "
"to help determine their worth.   \n"
"**Spellbook.** Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome "
"with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells.   \n"
"**Spyglass.** Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their "
"size.   \n"
"**Tent.** A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two.   \n"
"**Tinderbox.** This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder "
"(usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to "
"light a torch--or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel--takes an "
"action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.   \n"
"**Torch.** A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot "
"radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack "
"with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.\n"

"# Armor \n"
"Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different "
"cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers "
"have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain "
"mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in "
"between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor "
"found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, "
"medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a "
"shield.    \n"
"The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common "
"types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.    \n"
"**Armor Proficiency.** Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield "
"to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it "
"effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of "
"armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have "
"disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that "
"involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.     \n"
"**Armor Class (AC).** Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and "
"shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.   \n"
"**Heavy Armor.** Heavier armor interferes with the wearer's ability to move "
"quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows \"Str 13\" or "
"\"Str 15\" in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the "
"wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or "
"higher than the listed score.    \n"
"**Stealth.** If the Armor table shows \"Disadvantage\" in the Stealth "
"column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.     \n"
"**Shields.** A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one "
"hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit "
"from only one shield at a time. \n"

#, no-wrap
msgid ""
"## Light Armor \n"
"Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers "
"since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear "
"light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your "
"armor type to determine your Armor Class.    \n"
"**Padded.** Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.    "
"\n"
"**Leather.** The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made "
"of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the "
"armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.     \n"
"**Studded Leather.** Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather "
"is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes. \n"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: translations/equipment.merged.md:214
#, no-wrap
msgid ""
"## Medium Armor\n"
"Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs "
"movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to "
"a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your "
"Armor Class.    \n"
"**Hide.** This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly "
"worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to "
"the tools and materials needed to create better armor.    \n"
"**Chain Shirt.** Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn "
"between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection "
"to the wearer's upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against "
"one another to be muffled by outer layers.     \n"
"**Scale Mail.** This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a "
"separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much "
"like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.    \n"
"**Breastplate.** This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with "
"supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, "
"this armor provides good protection for the wearer's vital organs while "
"leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.     \n"
"**Half Plate.** Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most "
"of the wearer's body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple "
"greaves that are attached with leather straps. \n"
msgstr ""

#, no-wrap
msgid ""
"## Heavy Armor \n"
"Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These "
"suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range "
"of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.    \n"
"Heavy armor doesn't let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, "
"but it also doesn't penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.    "
"\n"
"**Ring Mail.** This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into "
"it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and "
"axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it's usually worn only by "
"those who can't afford better armor.     \n"
"**Chain Mail.** Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a "
"layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to "
"cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.    \n"
"**Splint.** This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to "
"a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail "
"protects the joints.     \n"
"**Plate.** Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the "
"entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a "
"visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles "
"and straps distribute the weight over the body.\n"

"# Coins \n"
"Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative "
"worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are "
"the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).     "
"\n"
"With one gold piece, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 feet of good rope, or "
"a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a "
"day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the "
"coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve "
"goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the "
"transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, "
"the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in "
"gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.    \n"
"One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among "
"commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for half a day, a flask of "
"lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.    \n"
"One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers "
"and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of "
"chalk.    \n"
"In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in "
"treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) "
"originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse "
"suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is "
"worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.    "

"# Mounts and Vehicles\n"
"A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but its "
"primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down. The "
"Mounts and Other Animals table shows each animal’s speed and base carrying "
"capacity.    \n"
"An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight "
"up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the "
"vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their "
"carrying capacity together.    \n"
"Mounts other than those listed here are available in fantasy gaming worlds, "
"but they are rare and not normally available for purchase. These include "
"flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and even "
"aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example). Acquiring such a mount often "
"means securing an egg and raising the creature yourself, making a bargain "
"with a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.    \n"
"**Barding.** Barding is armor designed to protect an animal’s head, neck, "
"chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on the Armor table can be purchased "
"as barding. The cost is four times the equivalent armor made for humanoids, "
"and it weighs twice as much.    \n"
"**Saddles.** A military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat "
"on an active mount in battle. It gives you advantage on any check you make "
"to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any aquatic or "
"flying mount.   \n"
"**Vehicle Proficiency.** If you have proficiency with a certain kind of "
"vehicle (land or water), you can add your proficiency bonus to any check you "
"make to control that kind of vehicle in difficult circumstances.    \n"
"**Rowed Vessels.** Keelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If "
"going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) "
"to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can’t be rowed against any "
"significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the "
"shores. A rowboat weighs 100 pounds, in case adventurers carry it over "
"land.\n"

"condition to sell.    \n"
"**Magic Items.** Selling magic items is problematic. Finding someone to buy "
"a potion or a scroll isn't too hard, but other items are out of the realm of "
"most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common magic "
"items, you won't normally come across magic items or spells to purchase. The "

"# Tools \n"
"A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or "
"repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your race, class, "
"background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency "
"with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check "
"you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since "
"proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. For "
"example, the GM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine "
"detail with your woodcarver's tools, or a Strength check to make something "
"out of particularly hard wood.   \n"
"**Artisan's Tools.** These special tools include the items needed to pursue "
"a craft or trade. The table shows examples of the most common types of "
"tools, each providing items related to a single craft. Proficiency with a "
"set of artisan's tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability "
"checks you make using the tools in your craft. Each type of artisan's tools "
"requires a separate proficiency.    \n"
"**Disguise Kit.** This pouch of cosmetics, hair dye, and small props lets "
"you create disguises that change your physical appearance. Proficiency with "
"this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make "
"to create a visual disguise.   \n"
"**Forgery Kit.** This small box contains a variety of papers and parchments, "
"pens and inks, seals and sealing wax, gold and silver leaf, and other "
"supplies necessary to create convincing forgeries of physical "
"documents. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to "
"any ability checks you make to create a physical forgery of a document.   \n"
"**Gaming Set.** This item encompasses a wide range of game pieces, including "
"dice and decks of cards (for games such as Three-Dragon Ante). A few common "
"examples appear on the Tools table, but other kinds of gaming sets exist. If "
"you are proficient with a gaming set, you can add your proficiency bonus to "
"ability checks you make to play a game with that set. Each type of gaming "
"set requires a separate proficiency.    \n"
"**Herbalism Kit.** This kit contains a variety of instruments such as "
"clippers, mortar and pestle, and pouches and vials used by herbalists to "
"create remedies and potions. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your "
"proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to identify or apply "
"herbs. Also, proficiency with this kit is required to create antitoxin and "
"_potions of healing_.    \n"
"**Musical Instrument.** Several of the most common types of musical "
"instruments are shown on the table as examples. If you have proficiency with "
"a given musical instrument, you can add your proficiency bonus to any "
"ability checks you make to play music with the instrument. A bard can use a "
"musical instrument as a spellcasting focus. Each type of musical instrument "
"requires a separate proficiency.    \n"
"**Navigator's Tools.** This set of instruments is used for navigation at "
"sea. Proficiency with navigator's tools lets you chart a ship's course and "
"follow navigation charts. In addition, these tools allow you to add your "
"proficiency bonus to any ability check you make to avoid getting lost at "
"sea.   \n"
"**Poisoner's Kit.** A poisoner's kit includes the vials, chemicals, and "
"other equipment necessary for the creation of poisons. Proficiency with this "
"kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to "
"craft or use poisons.   \n"
"**Thieves' Tools.** This set of tools includes a small file, a set of lock "
"picks, a small mirror mounted on a metal handle, a set of narrow-bladed "
"scissors, and a pair of pliers. Proficiency with these tools lets you add "
"your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to disarm traps or "
"open locks.\n"

"## Weapon Proficiency \n"
"Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons "
"or categories of weapons. The two categories are **simple** and "
"**martial**. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These "
"weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of "
"commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require "
"more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial "
"weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best "
"use.    \n"
"Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the "
"attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack "
"roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your "

"## Weapon Properties \n"
"Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the "
"Weapons table.    \n"
"**Ammunition.** You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to "
"make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the "
"weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of "
"ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container "
"is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At "
"the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by "
"taking a minute to search the battlefield.     \n"
"If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, "
"you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see \"Improvised Weapons\" "
"later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used "
"in this way.    \n"
"**Finesse.** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your "
"choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage "
"rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.   \n"
"**Heavy.** Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy "
"weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small "
"creature to use effectively.    \n"
"**Light.** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for "
"use when fighting with two weapons.    \n"
"**Loading.** Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire "
"only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, "
"or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally "
"make.    \n"
"**Range.** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in "
"parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two "
"numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second "
"indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal "
"range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target "
"beyond the weapon's long range.    \n"
"**Reach.** This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as "
"well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.    \n"
"**Special.** A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing "
"its use, explained in the weapon's description (see \"Special Weapons\" "
"later in this section).    \n"
"**Thrown.** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to "
"make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same "
"ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for "
"a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use "
"your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength "
"or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.    \n"
"**Two-Handed.** This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.    "
"\n"
"**Versatile.** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value "
"in parentheses appears with the property--the damage when the weapon is used "
"with two hands to make a melee attack. \n"

"## Improvised Weapons \n"
"Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with "
"whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield "
"in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a "
"wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.    \n"
"Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be "
"treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the GM's "
"option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if "
"it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.    \n"
"An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM "
"assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a "
"ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not "
"have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown "
"weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. \n"

"## Silvered Weapons Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to "
"nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious "
"adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can "
"silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost "
"represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise "
"needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective."

"## Special Weapons \n"
"Weapons with special rules are described here.    \n"
"**Lance.** You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target "
"within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you "
"aren't mounted.    \n"
"**Net.** A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is "
"freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that "
"are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength "
"check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a "
"success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the "
"creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.    \n"
"When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you "
"can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can "
