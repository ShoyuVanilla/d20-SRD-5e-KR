"# Advantage and Disadvantage \n"
"Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or "
"disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When "
"that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher "
"of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have "
"disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, "
"you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use "
"the 17.    \n"
"If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or "
"imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll more than one additional d20. If "
"two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only "
"one additional d20.    \n"
"If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you "
"are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true "
"even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants "
"advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor "
"disadvantage.    \n"
"When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as "
"the halfling's Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one "
"of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage "
"or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling "
"could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.    \n"
"You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special "
"abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character "
"advantage. The GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one "
"direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a "
"result.\n"

"# Conditions \n"
"Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can "
"arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other "
"effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such "
"as invisible, can be advantageous.    \n"
"A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is "
"countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the "
"effect that imposed the condition.    \n"
"If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance "
"of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get "
"worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.    \n"

"**Wretched.** You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, "
"you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, "
"and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched "
"lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow "
"you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and "
"adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are "
"beneath the notice of most people.    \n"
"**Squalid.** You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside "
"town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You "
"have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often "
"violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and "
"misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few "
"legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some "
"terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from "
"disease.    \n"
"**Poor.** A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a "
"stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and "
"unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, "
"experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the "
"common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you "
"still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this "
"lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, "
"thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.    \n"
"**Modest.** A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that "
"you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting "
"a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don't go hungry or thirsty, "
"and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living "
"modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, "
"priests, hedge wizards, and the like.    \n"
"**Comfortable.** Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford "
"nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small "
"cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine "
"inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military "
"officers.    \n"
"**Wealthy.** Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, "
"though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old "
"money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a "
"highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner "
"of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious "
"home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely "
"have a small staff of servants.    \n"
"**Aristocratic.** You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles "
"populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent "
"lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the "
"finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and "
"fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You "
"receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and "
"spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, "

"## Services \n"
"Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their "
"behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly "
"ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are "
"experts with specialized adventuring skills.    \n"
"Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services "
"table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who "
"inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a "
"specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an "
"elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the secret chest "
"spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A "
"bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming "
"performance in front of the duke.    \n"
"Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary "
"soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are "
"hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a "
"high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might "
"hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan "
"or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings "
"often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the "

"# Leveling Up\n"
"As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or she "
"gains experience, represented by experience points. A character who reaches "
"a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement "
"is called **gaining a level**.    \n"
"When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional "
"features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow "
"you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each "
"or increasing one score by 2. You can’t increase an ability score above "
"20. In addition, every character's proficiency bonus increases at certain "
"levels.    \n"
"Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit "
"Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total to your "
"hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your "
"class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).    \n"
"When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum "
"increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if your "
"7th-level fighter has a Constitution score of 18, when he reaches 8th level, "
"he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his "
"Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then increases by "
"8.    \n"
"The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance in "
"levels from level 1 through level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a "
"character of that level. Consult the information in your character's class "
"description to see what other improvements you gain at each level.\n"

"fighter, you're a 5th-level character.    \n"
"As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your "
"original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change "
"course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might "
"even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a "

"### Spellcasting \n"
"Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all "
"your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those "
"classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, "
"use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature "
"from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.    \n"
"**Spells Known and Prepared.** You determine what spells you know and can "
"prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member "
"of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three "
"1st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As "
"3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook "
"contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you "
"reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence "
"is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.    \n"
"Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and "
"you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the "
"spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used "
"only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.    \n"
"**Spell Slots.** You determine your available spell slots by adding together "
"all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, "
"and half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes. Use "
"this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass "
"Spellcaster table.    \n"
"If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you "
"spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can "
"prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level "
"spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like **_burning hands_**, has "
"an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the "
"enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher "
"level.    \n"
"For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you count as a "
"5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four "
"1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, "
"you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger "
"spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you "
"do know — and potentially enhance their effects.    \n"
"**Pact Magic.** If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact "
"Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you "
"gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared "
"from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell "
"slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells "
"you know.\n"

"# Proficiency Bonus \n"
"Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have "
"this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in "
"the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.   \n"
"Your proficiency bonus can't be added to a single die roll or other number "
"more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your "
"proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus "
"only once when you make the save.   \n"
"Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled "
"or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue's "
"Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability "
"checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more "
"than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or "
"divide it only once.   \n"
"By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your "
"proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn't normally "
"benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don't add the bonus to the "
"check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that "

"proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that "
"lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) "
"checks.   \n"
"In general, you don't multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or "
"saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules "
"apply.\n"
