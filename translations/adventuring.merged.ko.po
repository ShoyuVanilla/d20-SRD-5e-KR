"# Between Adventures \n"
"Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers "
"need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many "
"adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms "
"and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold.    \n"
"In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little "
"fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the GM might simply "
"declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe "
"in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the GM "
"might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond "
"your perception stay in motion. \n"

"## Lifestyle Expenses \n"
"Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost "
"of maintaining that lifestyle.    \n"
"Living a particular lifestyle doesn't have a huge effect on your character, "
"but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to "
"you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be "
"easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in "
"poverty. \n"

"## Downtime Activities \n"
"Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during "
"his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each "
"downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you "
"gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the "
"downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be "
"consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you "
"can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a "
"new downtime activity.    \n"
"Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you "
"want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not "
"covered here, discuss it with your GM. \n"

"### Crafting \n"
"You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works "
"of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are "
"trying to create (typically artisan's tools). You might also need access to "
"special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone "
"proficient with smith's tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or "
"suit of armor.    \n"
"For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more "
"items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw "
"materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft "
"has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5-gp "
"increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit "
"of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.    "
"\n"
"Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a "
"single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the "
"requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character "
"contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the "
"item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and "
"the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a "
"total cost of 750 gp.    \n"
"While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 "
"gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost. \n"

"### Practicing a Profession \n"
"You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle "
"without having to pay 1 gp per day. This benefit lasts as long you continue "
"to practice your profession.   \n"
"If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, "
"such as a temple or a thieves' guild, you earn enough to support a "
"comfortable lifestyle instead.    \n"
"If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance "
"skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy "

"### Researching \n"
"The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining "
"insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the "
"campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls "
"in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from "
"their lips.    \n"
"When you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is "
"available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether "
"there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a "
"specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also require you to "
"make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) "
"check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma "
"(Persuasion) check to secure someone's aid. Once those conditions are met, "
"you learn the information if it is available.    \n"
"For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your expenses. This "
"cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses. \n"

"First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines "
"how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.    "

"# Movement \n"
"Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a "
"treacherous mountain slope--all sorts of movement play a key role in fantasy "
"gaming adventures.   \n"
"The GM can summarize the adventurers' movement without calculating exact "
"distances or travel times: \"You travel through the forest and find the "
"dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.\" Even in a dungeon, "
"particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can summarize "
"movement between encounters: \"After killing the guardian at the entrance to "
"the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you "
"through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone "
"arch.\"    \n"
"Sometimes it's important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one "
"spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules "
"for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace "
"of the creatures moving and the terrain they're moving over. \n"

"## Speed Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in "

"### Travel Pace \n"
"While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow "
"pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party "
"can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast "
"pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible "
"to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.    \n"
"**Forced March.** The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 "
"hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of "
"exhaustion.    \n"
"For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the "
"distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must "
"make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 "
"for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers "
"one level of exhaustion.    \n"
"**Mounts and Vehicles.** For short spans of time (up to an hour), many "
"animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a "
"gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast "
"pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can "
"cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely "
"populated areas.    \n"
"Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as "
"normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the "
"vessel, and they don't suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits "
"from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships "
"might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.    \n"
"Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, "
"such as a _carpet of flying_, allow you to travel more swiftly.\n"

"**High Jump.** When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of "

"### Planar Travel \n"
"When adventurers travel into other planes of existence, they are undertaking "
"a legendary journey across the thresholds of existence to a mythic "
"destination where they strive to complete their quest. Such a journey is the "
"stuff of legend. Braving the realms of the dead, seeking out the celestial "
"servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in its home city will be "

"Travel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be accomplished in two "
"ways: by casting a spell or by using a planar portal.    \n"
"**Spells.** A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other "
"planes of existence. **_Plane shift_** and **_gate_** can transport "
"adventurers directly to any other plane of existence, with different degrees "
"of precision. **_Etherealness_** allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal "
"Plane and travel from there to any of the planes it touches--such as the "
"Elemental Planes. And the **_astral projection_** spell lets adventurers "
"project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to the Outer Planes.    "
"\n"
"**Portals.** A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar "
"connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific "
"location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a "
"fog-shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the interplanar "
"travel. Others are locations-- circles of standing stones, soaring towers, "
"sailing ships, or even whole towns--that exist in multiple planes at once or "
"flicker from one plane to another in turn. Some are vortices, typically "
"joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Material "
"Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the "

"**_astral projection_** allow characters to enter these planes and traverse "
"them to reach the planes beyond.    \n"
"The **Ethereal Plane** is a misty, fog-bound dimension that is sometimes "
"described as a great ocean. Its shores, called the Border Ethereal, overlap "
"the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those "
"planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures "

"seeing_** spell grant that ability. Some magical effects also extend from "
"the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly effects that use "
"force energy such as **_forcecage_** and **_wall of force_**. The depths of "
"the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region of swirling mists and colorful "

"When discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must be "

"Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the whims of the powerful "
"forces that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of the mighty forces that "
"dwell on these planes can remake them completely, effectively erasing and "
"rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill their own needs.    \n"
"Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The "

"stretch on to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to take a "
"guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a "

"When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a "
"number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At "
"the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it "
"can't regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.    \n"
"For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 "
"minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it "
"drops to 0 hit points. \n"

"## Vision and Light \n"
"The most fundamental tasks of adventuring--noticing danger, finding hidden "
"objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a "
"few--rely heavily on a character's ability to see. Darkness and other "
"effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.    \n"
"A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a **lightly obscured** "
"area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have "
"disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.   \n"
"A **heavily obscured** area--such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense "
"foliage--blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the "
"blinded condition when trying to see something in that area.    \n"

"The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories "
"of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.   \n"
"**Bright light** lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide "
"bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of "
"illumination within a specific radius.    \n"
"**Dim light**, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area "
"of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as "
"a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also "
"counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land "
"in dim light.    \n"
"**Darkness** creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness "
"outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an "
"unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness. \n"

"## Interacting with Objects \n"
"A character's interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to "
"resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that his or her character is "
"doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what, if "
"anything, happens.    \n"
"For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, "
"raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door "
"in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character "
"might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a "
"Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into "
"place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the "
"task.    \n"
"Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects "
"are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected "
"by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The GM determines "
"an object's Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain "
"objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It's hard "
"to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and "
"Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other "
"saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.    \n"
"A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM "
"sets the DC for any such check.\n"

"# Time \n"
"In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the "
"GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different time "
"scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon "
"environment, the adventurers' movement happens on a scale of **minutes**. It "
"takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to "
"check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes "
"to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.    \n"
"In a city or wilderness, a scale of **hours** is often more "
"appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the "
"forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours' time.     "
"\n"
"For long journeys, a scale of **days** works best. Following the road from "
"Baldur's Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four uneventful days "
"before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey.   \n"
"In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on **rounds**, a "
"6-second span of time.\n"
