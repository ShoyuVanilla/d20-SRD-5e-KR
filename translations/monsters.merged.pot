"**Tentacle.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one "

"disease has no effect for 1 minute and can be removed by any magic that "
"cures disease. After 1 minute, the diseased creature's skin becomes "
"translucent and slimy, the creature can't regain hit points unless it is "
"underwater, and the disease can be removed only by heal or another "
"disease-­‐curing spell of 6th level or higher. When the creature is outside "
